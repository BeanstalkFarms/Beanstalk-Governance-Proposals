## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Hello fellow Farmers,

I recently sat down with Publius to discuss our biggest gaps to growth right now as a platform and as a community.

Despite having one of the most unique products out there built by a team of technology purists who have poured blood, sweat, and tears into this product, we are all in agreement that there is one big gap we’re experiencing right now: slow user growth.

We are continually trending up with users, which is fantastic. But, we all want our growth to be faster.

**Faster growth requires two factors:**

1. Generating followers
2. Turning followers into investors

Generating followers happens from social media, influencer outreach, building discord and more.

Converting followers into investors means creating marketing messages that educate followers so they want to invest.

Our biggest gap right now is in converting followers into investors.

This problem exists because our core team is highly technically skilled. But we don’t have the same experience in sales and marketing. And these two skill sets are very, very different.

From our research, when people read about Beanstalk, our protocol can seem overly complex or confusing. It takes people time to understand our tech and our ecosystem.

This causes us to lose potential users who would normally invest if they understood the product more thoroughly.

The fact is, Beanstalk is a protocol where investors can earn 170% APY on their stablecoins without the risks inherent to centralization.

This is a unique position in the market and it needs to be communicated much more widely to our audience.

To do this, we are proposing we produce a high quality video for the home page that simplifies and explains the Beanstalk protocol that increases the number of followers who become investors in our platform.

We want to bring the same level of care and detail to our marketing messaging as Publius has poured into building this product.

You can read the Creative Brief we built after our deep dive with the core team here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plQrCzdIq18C6XJd7Dw4LmPxiApHsp6INZPmjHgd2JA/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plQrCzdIq18C6XJd7Dw4LmPxiApHsp6INZPmjHgd2JA/edit)

## THE PROCESS

To properly produce this video, this is the process:

1. **Research -** I have already done a 3 hour deep dive with your core team to understand the intricacies of the product.Script Ideation and Drafting - Create the first version of the video script.
2. **User Testing -** This part is the real magic behind this process. We read the script over and over to people one on one between 20-50 times. Each time, we refine the script, getting it more and more dialed in.
3. **Audio/Video Drafting -** As the script gets dialed in, then we add the audio and video components. This script will be using mostly 2D animation.
4. **Focus Group Testing -** After we get a draft of the video complete, we’ll play this in small focus groups to do another round of editing
5. **Editing Video -** We’ll continue editing the video until
6. **Final Product -** Final product ships and Beanstalk will start seeing higher conversion rates across the board.

Here’s are the roles required for producing this video properly:Research, scripting and editing Video editor Designer - (Beanstalk team) Animator Voice over artist Sound editor Motion graphic artist Focus group testing

## THE INVESTMENT

After building a detailed budget, completing this project requires an investment of $24,308.

The final deliverable will be a 2-4 minute video that is specifically designed to entertain, educate and enroll followers into investors in Beanstalk.

This video will be the first thing new followers see on the homepage, increasing the conversion rate of followers to investors.

## PAYMENT

We would be paid half (12,154 Beans) upfront upon passage of this proposal, and (12,154 Beans) upon successful completion of the project.

Payments will be distributed by Publius upon our direction.

The project will be completed within 8 weeks of agreement.

## THE SUMMARY

Our core team is all in agreement that we have a significant gap in our ability to turn followers into investors.

Each day we don’t have a better explanation of our product, it is costing us users and growth.

Taking the time to properly produce this type of video will produce an ROI for our platform and for our community for many, many seasons.
