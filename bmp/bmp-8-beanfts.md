## Summary

Beanstalkâ€™s mission is to be the leading decentralized stablecoin. To accomplish this, Beanstalk needs to simultaneously recruit new, ideally high-quality capital into the protocol while preserving the existing capital and userbase. The success of the first NFT drops was a good jumping off point to do both.

Beanstalk launched its BeaNFTs Genesis Collection during seasons 1200-1800 for 25 days to incentivize lenders to sow beans with a chance to win a unique NFT every season. The result has been a deepening and broadening of the community as 2,067 art-based Genesis Collection BeaNFTs varietals were created and collected by the top 10 sowers each season.

## Problem

While the Genesis Collection accomplished the goal of driving new users to the protocol and encouraged existing members to reinvest, work can be done to attract new capital, build Beanstalk brand awareness, and further enmesh existing users while providing value to their NFTs, as they evolve into one or several NFT categories.

BeaNFTs have been a fantastic tool to promote Beanstalk while ensuring growth and retention. In order for BeaNFTs to return the most value to all holders, current and future community members, and Beanstalk as a whole, we are creating and executing on a roadmap with milestones over the next 10 weeks. To grow excitement and momentum around the protocol, we need swift action with regards to BeaNFTs.

## Solution-based, High-level Deliverables

This BMP will set aside up to 20,000 Beans to do the following over the next 10 weeks:

1. Create BeaNFT roadmap for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 while taking into consideration both existing design assets so as to not overspend and account for upcoming BIP, BDP, and BMP changes
2. Deploy BeaNFT Collection 2 (ie B2) and potential future collections
3. Conduct weekly BeaNFT updates in Discord
4. Propose and execute on marketing budget to list BeaNFTs on NFT platforms (ex: rarity.tools)
5. Outline best practices for NFT roll-outs and create BeaNFT best practices
6. Maintain ongoing list of community feedback for future considerations and consider respective dev/design costs
7. Partner with development teams to finesse existing infrastructure and improve on any infrastructure changes, as needed
8. Partner with designer to create and ensure existing Beanstalk and BeaNFT brand identity is expanded upon (not lost) through loose design brand guidelines, as needed
9. Submit any necessary BMPs or BDPs for future dev/design work needs to execute on milestone enhancements beyond scope
10. Partner with other community members to help socialize
11. Create simple tutorials/docs for newcomers to understand how each part of the BeaNFT ecosystem works and pin in Discord
12. Preserve existing BeaNFT design while specing B2 and beyond to prevent dilution of existing Genesis Collection holders and considering use of remaining permutations
13. Ensure all code is in-house at Beanstalk Farms for future iterations of NFTs
14. Work with dev to ensure future contracts are upgradable and share impact to existing NFT holders

## High-level Timeline (Preliminary)

**Week 1:** Create and socialize BeaNFT roadmap. Start immediate dev/design work for B2 launch

**Weeks 2-3:** Prep social/marketing outreach and launch B2

**Weeks 3-6:** Maintain B2 Collection and ensure both mechanics to earn and receive NFTs functioning properly; draft bean design guidelines; begin dev/design work on next NFT milestones

**Weeks 6-10:** Finalize dev and design work for subsequent NFT milestones; roll out and socialize post-B2 Collection
