## Proposer

Ipoandchill

## Summary

Beanstalk Protocol should have a consistent & major presence on Instagram and TikTok in order to market, educate and acquire users. This also includes programming within the community (e.g. AMA’s) that will be used to integrate members into the community.

I propose assuming ownership of social media outreach & management of Instagram & Tiktok and also serving as the host of official Beanstalk AMA’s.

## Value

- **Social Media Experience:** I (ipoandchill, also @mitranyc on Instagram and TikTok) am currently a full-time social media influencer in the financial media space focusing exclusively on short-form video content that has generated 10m+ views over the past 12 months.
- **Hosting Experience:** I have hosted/moderated one Beanstalk AMA which received positive feedback. Have extensive experience hosting & moderating large format chats and ran two of the biggest South Asian rooms on Clubhouse, along with a litany of in-person events throughout my 10-year corporate career in finance. My hosting style is both engaging + informative and I have subject-matter expertise with regards to Bean, cryptocurrency & finance.
- **Incentives:** I have invested (via sowing) a significant portion of my personal savings into the Beanstalk protocol and as such, am highly interested in the long-term success of the platform. To that effect, I’d like my $BEAN compensation to be ‘sowed’ vs. paid outright to reflect this long-term commitment.

## Proposal & Details

I propose to both manage + create video content for Bean Protocol across both Instagram and TikTok while ensuring the best informational content & relevant news (e.g. updates within Discord) are reflected across platforms.

## Payment

one time payment of 10,000 $BEAN, to be sowed; includes the ongoing responsibilities outlined below:
