## Proposer

Dumpling

## Summary

- Allocate 2000 Beans to create Beanstalk merch and distribute them as reward for attendance of Beanstalk A&M University.
- Offer the first 30 attendees who attend 3 classes a complementary piece of Beanstalk merch.
- I will coordinate the creation and distribution of the merch.

## The Idea

Class attendance has been taken by user BeanMerchant (with the exception of University class #3, for which a DM to user Dumpling will suffice as proof of attendance). The first 30 attendees who attend 3 classes will be eligible for some merch.

I will coordinate production, shipping and payment of this merch. For those who prefer general a Beanstalk design rather than their specific BeaNFT, that can be arranged.

The default will be a T-shirt (American apparel) , but coffee mugs and green baseball hats are also similar pricing and are an option. Zazzle has some nice 15 oz mugs that can be customized, and the trucker hats also look nice.

## Payment

1500 Beans sent to Dumpling upon approval of this proposal to fund the creation and distribution of the merch.

500 sown Beans to Dumpling for labor paid upon successful distribution of the merch.

## Submission

I will handle the management of shipping details so there is no need to send them to a public place.
