This is a proposal to create an Explanatory Simplified Animated Video for Beanstalk NFT.

My name is JB The Wizard and I’m an actor from Prison Break and have been in the crypto space since before ETH was invented.

I love an appreciate the NFT community and am an NFT Film Consultant and Director.

When I came to the Bean website I was ready to get involved and even had a wallet connected and on more than one occasion simply “rejected” the transaction and left the page.

I believe in the Bean project, the product, the methodology and the protocol.

Despite all of that, I left the site.

There are currently and will continue to be millions of dollars lost because of the exact same problem I encountered. I also believe that “Millions” lost is a severe understatement.

I’ve created films for Transamerica, a Fortune 500 Multi-billion dollar organization helping overcomplicated concepts with clarity as well.

The most important aspect to this project and creating something that will convert buyers, owners, participants are as follows:

1. A clear story and message to bring the new user into the Bean family with clarity and trust IMMEDIATELY. No one has the time or interest to research a Discord server or go through article after article on Medium or attempt to understand technical analysis of the inner workings of a niche product. Video is a powerful storyteller for this. It’s fast and efficient and simple for everyone.
2. Execute on the production. Creating animations or developing a video are extremely straightforward and simple if you know how to animate but what story to tell or how to communicate it is where things first must be clear.
3. The deliverable should be within 8-weeks.

This is it.

My fee is 10k + a percentage of the project/whatever makes sense. I’ll direct and write the script and project based off of further understanding and asking questions of the creators, developers, and likely the community to understand the foundation, purpose, story, outcomes desired, and even reasons why current adopters bought in. Feel free to look at my LinkedIn page for some references and some experiences or google JB The Wizard.

The suggested fee for the animation and devs is 8k. If that amount isn’t required then what’s not used is returned to the DAO. Cheaper work typically costs more time and more money in the long run because of inability to create quality work and decreased conversions for those potential sales/Bean collectors.

The reason I connected is because I consult and coach high-end projects and the potential for this is through the roof and as functional as the tech is and as intelligent as the founders and early adopters are, it’s not translating at all through the articles or the website and that means a tremendous loss of capital and movement for both the NFT’s themselves and the holder’s investments.

10k is obviously a minimal investment compared to the ROI of what we’re looking for but I’m great at what I do and believe this can be done efficiently.

Thank you so much for your time, your ears, and your eyes. This is an amazing project and I hope to be able to provide even more clarity for more people who would tremendously benefit from the hard work that has gone into it.

Sincere regards, -The Wizard
