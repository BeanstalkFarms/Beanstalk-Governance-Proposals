## Proposer

Publius

## Summary

As Beanstalk continues to grow, the website could use a little bit of a facelift. To date, we have had an artist, who would prefer to stay anonymous, work on the Halloween and Thanksgiving themes for the website. We want them to give the graphics on the website a much needed upgrade, and work on a variety of themed iterations (we will keep them secret, not to spoil the fun!) of the website.

## Payment

5,000 Beans, paid upon approval.

## Timing

If approved, the payment will be distributed by Publius in a lump sum upon approval.

## Voting

Vote yes to approve the budget allocation. Vote no to disapprove of the budget allocation.
