## Introduction

Beanstalk Farms is an independent decentralized development organization of core contributors working on Beanstalk. Beanstalk Farms has historically been funded by the Beanstalk DAO and proposed quarterly budget BIPs that mint Beans to cover operating expenses and compensate contributors. 

In response to the Q1 budget BIP failing to reach quorum, Beanstalk Farms redesigned the budget to cover the first half of 2023 (as opposed to just Q1) to enable core contributors to work towards the following goals:

* Decentralized development: continue to develop a diverse organization without any single points of failure or dependence.
* Focus and flexibility: deliver high quality output in a timely fashion, while maintaining the flexibility to fund and support a wide variety of unique opportunities related to Beanstalk.
* Attracting high quality talent: continue to attract and retain high quality talent, which is critical to the success of Beanstalk.

## Q4 2022 Spending and Output

At the beginning of Q4 on October 1, 2022, the [Beanstalk Farms Multisig](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk-farms/bfm-dashboard) (BFM) held 160,702 Beans and 190,094 USDC.

The Q4 2022 Beanstalk Farms budget of 1,000,000 additional Beans was [minted](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd335b3be7582515f195287daa53de7fe8bd9c88d056a30f438be2c8e7bb457a8) per [BIP-25](https://arweave.net/O9-WKx4x7cu6YFeeowI5i1IG3kcaxQ1vwtr-hduWQos) on October 5, 2022 to fund protocol development and support initiatives.

As of December 31, 2022, the BFM had 419,577 Beans and 139,407 USDC, resulting in a quarterly spend of 741,125 Beans and 50,687 USDC. As of January 31, 2023, the balances in the BFM were 203,194 Beans and 139,012 USDC.

## Anticipated H1 2023 Hiring

In order to execute on Beanstalk Farms' ambitious [on-chain ecosystem roadmap](https://community.bean.money/roadmap), there is significant development work to be done at the protocol level and from a tooling perspective, both for developers and for users. In order to get there in H1 2023, Beanstalk Farms intends to additionally hire (at least):

* 1 full-time Solidity Engineer, who will help build much of the tech in the on-chain roadmap;
* 1 full-time Subgraph Engineer, who will focus maintaining and upgrading fully-featured subgraphs for Beanstalk, the Bean token, Wells, etc.; and
* 3 full-time Full Stack Engineers, who will focus on upgrading the Beanstalk UI and building other interfaces to maintain feature parity with all on-chain ecosystem development, including Wells. 

## Anticipated H1 2023 Output

#### Security

* Continue coordinating with Immunefi whitehats, the BIC, the BCM and Halborn to respond to issues surfaced in bug reports;
* Seek to engage at least one more audit firm to continuously audit Beanstalk in addition to Halborn;
* Seek to set up audit competitions for new BIPs via Code4rena;
* Continue coordinating with Halborn on BIP audits and improve Beanstalk documentation to better set Halborn and future auditors for success; and
* Establish community standards for timelines around publishing new code.

#### On-chain Development

See [this page](https://community.bean.money/roadmap) for a detailed on-chain roadmap.

* Release NatSpec documentation for all functions within Beanstalk, supporting the ability of developers, auditors and whitehats to better and more quickly understand Beanstalk;

* Implement various additional Well functions (such as Curve V2); 
* Continue assisting Root, Paradox and other third parties building on the Beanstalk ecosystem;
* Explore and implement the beginning stages of a suitable on-chain governance structure; and
* Explore possible implementations of downside reflexivity for Temperature changes.

#### Middleware

* Reach feature parity between the Bean and Beanstalk subgraphs and Beanstalk;
* Build a subgraph to index on-chain Well data;
* Continue development on the Beanstalk SDK (first migrating all existing UI functionality into the SDK, and then extending the SDKâ€™s capabilities related to composing transactions);
* Begin development of various ecosystem SDKs on top of Pipeline, Tractor and Wells; and
* Continue to build and maintain various ecosystem bots as Beanstalk, Root, etc. are upgraded and the Beanstalk ecosystem expands.

#### Frontend + Design

* Launch a generalized UI for Wells in tandem with its on-chain deployment;
* Refactor the UI to condense the Withdraw and Claim steps into one step after the Withdrawal timer is reduced to zero;

## Budget

#### Q1 2023

We propose a total of 400,000 Beans are minted to fund Beanstalk Farms through the end of Q1 2023. Combined with funds unspent at the end of Q4 2022, this results in a total available Q1 2023 budget of 819,575 Beans and 139,407 USDC. 

Beanstalk Farms is spending approximately 260,000 Beans worth of value per month based on a Q4 2022 average. The Q1 budget, as illustrated below, focuses on fulfilling ongoing operational requirements and does not provide a surplus of funds.

![image](https://arweave.net/qUNXC5iD39ji0YibgVe-58exbf_L9BzkyvgHcKbuekg)

#### Q2 2023

We also propose a total of 950,000 Beans are minted to fund Beanstalk Farms through the end of Q2 2023, in line with a run rate of 260,000 Beans per month (780,000 Beans per quarter) plus 170,000 Beans primarily intended to enable Beanstalk Farms to hire 3-4 more engineersâ€”see *Anticipated H1 2023 Hiring*. It is better to have budget Beans that can be rolled over into the following quarterâ€™s budget than to not have enough Beans to fund important initiatives. A larger budget also allows Beanstalk Farms to offer development grants to fund various projects in the ecosystem.

Minting the Q2 budget in advance reduces the friction involved in funding Beanstalk Farms. A suitable governance structure will still allow the DAO the opportunity to withhold Q2 funding at its discretionâ€”see *Governance*.

## Audit Fund

We propose a total of 500,000 Beans are minted to create the Audit Fund. The Audit Fund will be solely dedicated to funding audits of Beanstalk and Beanstalk ecosystem code. The Audit Fund is expected to be used to cover future Halborn audits, a Code4rena audit competition and to potentially engage another smart contract auditing firm.

The Audit Fund will be custodied by the BFM. All spending from the Audit Fund will require approval through a Beanstalk Farms Budget Proposal (BFBP), and the balance of the Audit Fund will be reported in the [Beanstalk Farms Operations Reports](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Farms-Operations).

## Custody

The funds for Beanstalk Farms budget and the Audit Fund will be custodied by the BFM wallet with keys held by various community members and Publius. We propose the following signers and backup signers for the BFM:

BFM Signers (all current signers)

* Publius
* Silo Chad
* guy
* sweetredbeans
* mod323
* aloceros
* Cujo

The following serve as backup signers for the BFM, in no particular order:

* Al Bean
* CanadianBennett
* MrMochi

## Governance

Beanstalk Farms will continue to utilize the processes for Beanstalk Farms Committee Proposals (BFCP) and Beanstalk Farms Budget Proposals (BFBP), per the processes outlined in [BFP-81](https://arweave.net/xw65ZkEw_9PwmNbrHsGsxEdMcbv7r9dG5CusZqdz0So) and amended in [BIP-25](https://arweave.net/O9-WKx4x7cu6YFeeowI5i1IG3kcaxQ1vwtr-hduWQos). The Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC) is responsible for oversight of other Beanstalk Farms contributors. More information on the BFCP and BFBP process can be found [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/proposals#bfcp) and [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/proposals#bfbp).

We propose that the minimum threshold for which a BFBP-C is required be changed from transactions valued at >10,000 Beans or USDC to transactions valued at >25,000 Beans or USDC.

We propose that the BFM be able to vote on governance proposals using its Stalk at the discretion of the BFC. The BFM will not vote on BFCPs due to the conflict of interest. Note that not all budget Beans are Depositedâ€”see *Incentive Alignment*.

We propose that the DAO can propose a BOP to disallow Beanstalk Farms from using the 950,000 Beans minted for use in Q2 upon the completion of Q1 (end of March 2023). This preserves the DAO's ability to withhold funding on a quarterly cadence, but reduces the friction involved with funding Beanstalk Farms by minting the Q2 budget upfront. If such a BOP were proposed and approved by the DAO, Beanstalk Farms will burn the 950,000 Beans minted for Q2.

## Responsibilities

Beanstalk Farms values all feedback from the DAO. However, due to limited resources, it is not feasible to prioritize every request. Beanstalk Farms prioritizes work that it deems the highest leverage contributions that it can provide to Beanstalk given current bandwidth. If a request is not taken on, Beanstalk Farms may still offer guidance or assistance to help the community address the issue in other ways, such as helping facilitate direct and permissionless contributions through governance or other organizations in the Beanstalk ecosystem.

BFC members will make every effort to attend DAO meetings regularly and address any questions that arise, but otherwise do not have a duty to respond to specific inquiries within a certain time frame. Ultimately, the BFC and contributors are accountable to the DAO through the selection of BFC members by the DAO in governance.

## Initial Allocations

Each new Beanstalk Farms contributor must have a new individual Snapshot proposal, either via BFCP-A or BFBP-A, utilizing the above processes. Current contributors will only require a Snapshot proposal if their pay rate has increased or role/commitment has significantly changed since the terms of the proposal in effect.

A budget of 15,000 Beans per month will be allocated to the community grant program to reward creators of new Beanstalk-related content that focuses on Beanstalk and its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem. Unused Beans in a month will not roll over to subsequent months, including the unused Beans rolled over to date. More information [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/community/community-grant-program).

## Incentive Alignment

In order to best align the incentives of contributors to Beanstalk with its long term success, Beanstalk Farms will continue using the Deposit compensation structure as described in the Incentive Alignment section of [BIP-22](https://arweave.net/6aaL15siu33-dSL5wbrF0t10xzhIZ1IDQTVK-dINsHw).

The BFM will execute a `plant` transaction when Earned Beans increases the amount distributed by greater than 1% or when a contributor has departed from Beanstalk Farms.

## Competitive Pay

Beanstalk Farms recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive compensation is essential to Beanstalkâ€™s long-term success. This budget proposal ensures that it can meet or exceed market rates.

## Contract Changes

None.

## Beans Minted

The `init` function on the `InitMint` contract at [0x077495925c17230E5e8951443d547ECdbB4925Bb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077495925c17230E5e8951443d547ECdbB4925Bb#code) is called.

We propose a total of 1,850,000 Beans are minted for the budget and the Audit Fund to the BFM address ([0x21DE18B6A8f78eDe6D16C50A167f6B222DC08DF7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21DE18B6A8f78eDe6D16C50A167f6B222DC08DF7)) upon the execution of BIP-33.

## Effective

Immediately upon commitment.
