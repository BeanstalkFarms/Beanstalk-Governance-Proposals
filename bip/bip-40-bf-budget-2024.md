## Introduction

Beanstalk Farms is an independent decentralized development organization of contributors working on Beanstalk. Beanstalk Farms has historically been funded by the Beanstalk DAO and proposed budget BIPs that mint Beans to cover operating expenses and compensate contributors. 

The most recent Beanstalk Farms budget BIP was [BIP-33](https://arweave.net/-iklnExU_oJl3N2Lh0wnnGqeT8cTV0L6d6YOpbn2iKc). Although this budget was originally only intended to cover operations through H1 2023, Beanstalk Farms has been operating on these funds through January 2024 (7 additional months). 

Beanstalk Farms has demonstrated an ability to execute with limited resources. However, Beanstalk Farms will be unable to continue development of Beanstalk beyond February 2024 without additional funding. There are a number of open RFCs that various Farmers have indicated a willingness to work on should a new budget be approved by the DAO.

Beanstalk Farms designed the 2024 budget to cover operations through the end of the year to enable contributors to work towards the following goals:

* Decentralized development: continue to develop a diverse organization without any single points of failure or dependence.
* Focus and flexibility: deliver high quality output in a timely fashion, while maintaining the flexibility to fund and support a wide variety of unique opportunities related to Beanstalk.
* Attracting high quality talent: continue to attract and retain high quality talent, which is critical to the success of Beanstalk.

## 2023 Spending and Output

Before the BIP-33 budget was minted on February 9, 2023, the [Beanstalk Farms Multisig](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk-farms/bfm-dashboard) (BFM) held 186,694 Beans and 139,012 USDC.

The H1 2023 Beanstalk Farms budget of 1,350,000 additional Beans and Audit Fund of 500,000 Beans was approved by the DAO to fund protocol development, audits and related initiatives.

As of February 12, 2024, the remaining Beanstalk Farms budget consists of 36,647 Beans and 28,820 USDC, with 146,537 additional Beans in the Security Fund (f.k.a. Audit Fund).

* Deploy all ecosystem subgraphs (Beanstalk, Bean, Basin, BeaNFT, etc.) to the The Graph's decentralized subnet (and switch the default subgraph used by the UIs to these decentralized deployments);
* Continue to upgrade and maintain the Beanstalk and Bean Subgraphs as Beanstalk is upgraded (along with adding more data like pre-exploit deltaB values, more historical Barn data, etc.);

        * Data on the prices at which Converts are common;
        * etc.

#### Breakdown

The following is a brief outline of how the budget is expected to be spent according to the items described above. Note that while these are estimations in attempt to give insight into a breakdown of the budget, the BFC ultimately has the ability to decide on payment amounts per the latest DAO approved process documented [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/proposals).

* ~35,000 Beans/mo to pay ~2 Solidity Engineers who will implement the tech described in the RFCs, support and answer questions from auditors who review the code, etc. (see the *On-chain Development* section);
* ~30,000 Beans/mo to pay ~2 Full Stack Engineers to work on the Beanstalk and Basin UIs as ecosystem upgrades are made, increasing feature parity between the UIs and the protocols, etc. (see the *Frontend + Design* section);
* ~16,000 Beans/mo to pay ~1 Full Stack Engineer to build out the ecosystem's analytics suite, subgraphs and potentially the Tractor UI after that (see the *Middleware* and *Frontend + Design* sections); and
* ~20,000 Beans/mo to pay ~1 Full Stack Engineer to build out the entire middleware suite for Tractor (indexer, SDK, etc.) to launch markets for automated farming, a convert order book, etc., in addition to maintaining and upgrading the ecosystem bots (see *Middleware* section).

Beanstalk Farms anticipates spending approximately 100,000 Beans per month outside of audits.

## Budget

#### H1 2024

We propose a total of 500,000 Beans are minted to fund Beanstalk Farms through the end of H1 2024. Combined with funds unspent at the time of budget proposal, this results in a total available H1 2024 budget of 536,647 Beans and 28,820 USDC. 

#### H2 2024

We also propose a total of 500,000 Beans are minted to fund Beanstalk Farms through the end of H2 2024.

Minting the H2 budget in advance reduces the friction involved in funding Beanstalk Farms and better allow Beanstalk Farms to attract top quality talent. A suitable governance structure will still allow the DAO the opportunity to withhold H2 funding at its discretion—see *Governance*.

#### Projected Spending

![image](https://arweave.net/uNymJ5l0qJwc04x8VSjHRugzCo7A2Eo27ygNT6QYh74)

The chart above illustrates the proposed use of the H1 and H2 budget.

## Security Fund

We propose a total of 450,000 Beans are minted to fund the Security Fund. Combined with funds unspent at the time of budget proposal, this results in a total Security Fund of 596,537 Beans.

The Security Fund will be solely dedicated to funding audits and other security initiatives in the Beanstalk ecosystem. The Security Fund is expected to be used to cover future Cyfrin audits, an audit competition for Beanstalk, etc.

The Security Fund will be custodied by the BFM. All spending over 25,000 Beans from the Security Fund will require approval through a Beanstalk Farms Budget Proposal (BFBP), and the balance of the Security Fund will be reported in the [Beanstalk Farms Operations Reports](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Farms-Operations).

## Custody

The funds for the Beanstalk Farms 2024 budget and the Security Fund will be custodied by the BFM wallet with keys held by various community members. We propose the following signers and backup signers for the BFM:

BFM Signers (all current signers)

* aloceros
* Brean
* Cujo
* guy
* Michael Montoya
* mod323
* sweetredbeans

The following serve as backup signers for the BFM, in no particular order:

* CanadianBennett
* MrMochi
* pizzaman1337

## Governance

Beanstalk Farms will continue to utilize the processes for Beanstalk Farms Committee Proposals (BFCPs) per the processes outlined in [BFP-81](https://arweave.net/xw65ZkEw_9PwmNbrHsGsxEdMcbv7r9dG5CusZqdz0So) and amended in [BIP-25](https://arweave.net/O9-WKx4x7cu6YFeeowI5i1IG3kcaxQ1vwtr-hduWQos) and [BIP-35](https://arweave.net/6io_TThM36tFXmaM-AW52xygYKQ2oxUbGA8jydtanMc) (the latest DAO approved processes are documented [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/proposals)).

We propose that the any Farmer can propose a BOP (i.e., a Farmer with at least 0.1% Stalk at the time of proposal) before June 30, 2024 to disallow Beanstalk Farms from using the 500,000 Beans minted for use in H2. This preserves the DAO's ability to withhold funding on a regular cadence, but reduces the friction involved in funding Beanstalk Farms by minting the H2 budget upfront. If such a BOP were proposed and approved by the DAO, Beanstalk Farms will burn the 500,000 Beans minted for H2.

## Responsibilities

Beanstalk Farms values all feedback from the DAO. However, due to limited resources, it is not feasible to prioritize every request. Beanstalk Farms prioritizes work that it deems the highest leverage contributions that it can provide to Beanstalk given current bandwidth. If a request is not taken on, Beanstalk Farms may still offer guidance or assistance to help the community address the issue.

Beanstalk Farms contributors (including BFC members) do not have a duty to respond to specific inquiries within a certain time frame. Ultimately, Beanstalk Farms contributors are accountable to the DAO through the selection of BFC members by the DAO in governance.

A member of the BFC (see Rex's BFCP-A) will be expected to host monthly DAO meetings with the community (February thru December 2024). Contributors being paid by Beanstalk Farms are expected to make every effort to attend the DAO meetings regularly and share what they are working on and updates on expected development timelines.

## Contract Changes

None.

## Beans Minted

The `init` function on the `InitMint` contract at [0x077495925c17230E5e8951443d547ECdbB4925Bb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x077495925c17230E5e8951443d547ECdbB4925Bb#code) is called.

We propose a total of 1,450,000 Beans are minted for the budget and the Security Fund to the BFM address ([0x21DE18B6A8f78eDe6D16C50A167f6B222DC08DF7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21DE18B6A8f78eDe6D16C50A167f6B222DC08DF7)) upon the execution of this BIP.

## Effective

Immediately upon commitment.
