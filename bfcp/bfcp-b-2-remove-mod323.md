## Voting Choices
Keep mod323 as BFC member
Remove mod323 from BFC

## Background
According to Beanstalk Farms governance, at least 3 BFC members will control Beanstalk Farms. Accordingly, BFCP-C-3 extended the terms of guy, mod323, sweetredbeans until end of H2 2023.

## Proposal
Considering the current BFC teams members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community, BIP-39 is proposed to remove the current BFC members (guy, mod323, sweetredbeans) by rescinding BFCP-C-3. 

Immediately following the successful removal of the current BFC members hold an emergency BIP to elect 3 new BFC members into the BFC that will engage more with the community and provide substanstive updates and timelines.

## Rationale
Need a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.

## New BFC Members
Going forward BFC members should be able to effectively communicate development and audit plans and timelines. There are several Farmers who have effectively done this type of work in other communities (some of which are currently working on protocols that would benefit Beanstalk). We will propose a list of names as we progress with the removal of the current BFC members.
