**Please note that "sweetredbeans" has not participated in any active discussions on Discord in months. It is unclear why this individual would want to participate in BFC unless he/him/they is a just a proxy for Publius' interests (which would be good for BFC to disclose).**

The farm needs a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently, all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors. 

**In addition, several bot operators (some of whom are in direct contact and affiliated with current BFC members) have direct knowledge of development timelines and product development that help maximize their current stakes while keeping this information hidden from the broader farmer community to react and operate on the same playing field.**

## Proposer
Beanstalk Farmer (not a troll or proposal based on frustration as noted by BFC minions to delegitimize the proposal)

## Summary
Remove "sweetredbeans" from BFC. We proposed the removal of "sweetredbeans" via BFCP-B-3, BFCP-B-5 and BFCP-B-7 but the current BFC members failed to announce the proposal on Discord to notify farmers (how convenient they only announce proposals they agree with). In addition, they had their minions delegitimize the proposal to reduce voter turnout. We hope the BFC makes the proper announcements for this proposal (we will keep proposing until BFC presents it to the farmers via Discord announcements).    

## Quorum Note
Quorum is 35% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.

## Voting Choices
- Keep "sweetredbeans" as BFC member
- Remove "sweetredbeans" from BFC

## Background
According to Beanstalk Farms governance, at least 3 BFC members will control Beanstalk Farms. Accordingly, BFCP-C-3 extended the terms of guy, mod323, sweetredbeans until end of H2 2023. 

## Proposal
Considering the current BFC team members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community, this BFCP is proposed to remove the current BFC member "sweetredbeans" by rescinding BFCP-C-3. 

Immediately following the successful removal of the current BFC members, we will hold an emergency BIP to elect 3 new BFC members into the BFC that will engage more with the community and provide substantive updates and timelines.

## Rationale
Need a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently, all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.

## New BFC Members
Going forward BFC members should be able to effectively communicate development and audit plans and timelines. Several Farmers have effectively done this type of work in other communities (some of which are currently working on protocols that would benefit Beanstalk). We will propose a list of names as we progress with the removal of the current BFC members.
