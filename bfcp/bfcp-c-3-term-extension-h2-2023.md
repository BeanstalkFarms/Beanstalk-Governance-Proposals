## Proposer

Beanstalk Farms Committee

## Summary

Extend the terms of current BFC members.

## Quorum Note

Quorum is 25% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.

There are 3 voting choices*, and each represents voting For an individual BFC member's proposal. Abstaining from a voting choice while voting For any other choices is equivalent to voting against. Quorum and a majority vote For is required for an individual BFC member’s proposal to pass.

**Voting choices (For)**

* Extend guy's term
* Extend mod323's term
* Extend sweetredbeans' term

*Note that Silo Chad elected to leave the BFC.

## Proposal

According to Beanstalk Farms governance, at least 3 BFC members must approve any spending of the Beanstalk Farms budget. BFC members have term lengths—currently, mod323's term ends in September 2023 and the other 2 members' terms end in December 2023.

Therefore, in order to continue facilitating an efficient use of the remaining Beanstalk Farms budget, BFCP-C-3 is proposed.

All current BFC members have elected to waive the compensation established in their respective BFCP-A proposals.
