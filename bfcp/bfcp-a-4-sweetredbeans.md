## Proposer

sweetredbeans

## Quorum

25%: 53,332,329 Stalk

## Summary

Add sweetredbeans to the Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC) and hire them as Product Lead.

## Background

I was previously a product manager at a large software company and spent time in product roles at multiple startups prior to Beanstalk.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

**Product Design:**

Prior to the exploit, I onboarded several contributors to Beanstalk Farms from my network and helped out part-time with product and design work.

After the exploit, I was the sole contributor designing the UI V2 for Beanstalk. I’d encourage the DAO to browse a view-only version of the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=9297%3A101886) (2000+ frames!) that encapsulates much of my work over the last 3 months. For those who prefer to read, my work on the new UI consisted of: 

* Building the pre-Unpause [Barn Raise page](https://app.bean.money/) (more updates coming!).
* Building the entire [design system](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=4276%3A104961) from scratch while maintaining feature parity with UI V1.
* Conceiving of and building net new features to include in Beanstalk UI V2 such as [the Season table](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=4715%3A55931), [the Forecast page](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=7109%3A146676), and the [Silo Deposits graph](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=9242%3A100738).
* [Componentizing](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=4276%3A104961) and standardizing all work in Figma to be easily extensible for future iterations and other contributors.

## Role

While we’re about to ship a newly styled version of the dApp—with a stronger visual language and standardized design system which will scale—I believe that we’ll need to shift gears and adjust our framing to focus on improving usability.

Because my time has mostly been spent re-building the Beanstalk UI to this point, I expect my day-to-day work will adjust slightly post-Unpause. I expect my role to consist of: 

* Setting up a more formal research and discovery process to find usability gaps in the product (via community involvement).
* Researching and developing design patterns for future Beanstalk functionality (a generalized transaction builder for the farm() function).
* Improving the new UI to lean into more custom, interactive, and visual components (a high fidelity Pod Line visualization, more details on whitelisted Silo tokens—particularly if they are trading pairs, more informative charts for Silo Deposits, etc).
* Working with engineering to onboard high-quality product talent (PM’s, designers & engineers).
* Driving a process to gather & understand usage data.
* Building dark mode :).

As Beanstalk grows, I’d like to propose myself to be on the BFC so I can support the DAO in finding the right product and design people to build a great interface for Beanstalk.

## Payment

22,500 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause.

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
