The farm needs a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors. In addition, several bot operators (some whom are in direct contact and affiliated with current BFC members) have direct knowledge of development timelines and product development that help maximize their current stakes while keeping this information hidden from the broader farmer community to react and operate on the same playing field.

## Proposer
Beanstalk Farmer (Per the BFC minions, explicit approval is needed. "Rex" has given explicit approval through another farmer. "Rex" can confirm on Discord again)

## Summary
Add "rexthebean" aka "Rex"to BFC. We proposed the addition of "Rex" via BFCP-A-5 and BFCP-A-8 but the current BFC members failed to announce the proposal on Discord to notify farmers. In addition, they had their minions delegitimize the proposal to reduce voter turnout. We hope the BFC makes the proper announcements for this proposal (we will keep proposing until BFC presents it to the farmers via Discord announcements).

## Quorum Note
Quorum is 25% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.

## Voting Choices
Add "rexthebean" aka "Rex" to BFC
Don't Add "rexthebean" aka "Rex" to BFC

## Background
The Farm needs an outside independent member that is willing to communicate with the broader community. The current BFC have failed to engage with the community and have not been transparent with the current development timelines and audits.

## Proposal
Considering the current BFC teams members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community, this BFCP is proposed to add an additional BFC member "Rex". He/him/they is an active member of the community and stalk delegate. The following background on "Rex" as provided in his/him/they delegate thread:

"I held the role of Department Head for the Community Team from February 2022 until after the exploit when that group was disbanded. I've been hosting The BeanPod podcast since that time as well, recording nearly 40 episodes. I've also had the good fortune to host the Radio DeFi podcast.

The goal of the DAO should be to provide individuals impacted by the protocol the ability to have a voice in shaping and governing it. What I appreciate about the delegate system is that it allows anyone the ability to say "I want my votes to be counted, but I don't have the bandwidth to make informed decisions, so I'm entrusting ___ to do so on my behalf."

## Rationale
Need a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.

## New BFC Members
Going forward BFC members should be able to effectively communicate development and audit plans and timelines. We will support paying these contributors so long as they effectively keep communicating with farmers.
