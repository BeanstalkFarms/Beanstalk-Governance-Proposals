Note: This proposal incorrectly claims the terms of the existing BFC members have expired. [BFCP-C-3](https://arweave.net/jAKE7eYNIqJOGVsbG5xU8EZDQPKCCXIipFzJo02tMys) extends the term of guy and sweetredbeans to June 2024 and mod323 to March 2024.

**Per BFCP-C-3, the term for existing BFC members (guy, mod323 and sweetredbeans) has expired. Therefore, in order to continue facilitating an efficient use of the remaining Beanstalk Farms budget and efficient communication of updates, we are proposing to add "rexthebean" aka "Rex" to the BFC.**

> "It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices [checks and balances] should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.” — James Madison

The farm needs a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors. In addition, several bot operators (some whom are in direct contact and affiliated with H2 2023 BFC members) have direct knowledge of development timelines and product development that help maximize their current stakes while keeping this information hidden from the broader farmer community to react and operate on the same playing field.

## Proposer
Beanstalk Farmer (Per the BFC minions, explicit approval is needed. "Rex" has given explicit approval through another farmer. "Rex" can confirm on Discord again)

## Summary
Add "rexthebean" aka "Rex" to the BFC. We proposed the addition of "Rex" via BFCP-A-8, BFCP-A-9, BFCP-A-10, BFCP-A-11 and BFCP-A-13 but the previous BFC members failed to announce the proposal on Discord to notify farmers. In addition, they had their minions delegitimize the proposal to reduce voter turnout. We hope the BFC makes the proper announcements for this proposal (we will keep proposing until BFC presents it to the farmers via Discord announcements).

## Quorum Note
Quorum is 25% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.

## Voting Choices
- Add "rexthebean" aka "Rex" to BFC
- Don't Add "rexthebean" aka "Rex" to BFC

## Background
The Farm needs an outside independent member that is willing to communicate with the broader community. The H2 2023 BFC failed to engage with the community and have not been transparent with the current development timelines and audits.

## Proposal
Considering the H2 2023 BFC teams members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community and have no timelines, this BFCP is proposed to add a "Rex" as a BFC member. He/him/they is an active member of the community and stalk delegate. The following background on "Rex" as provided in his/him/they delegate thread:

"I held the role of Department Head for the Community Team from February 2022 until after the exploit when that group was disbanded. I've been hosting The BeanPod podcast since that time as well, recording nearly 40 episodes. I've also had the good fortune to host the Radio DeFi podcast.

The goal of the DAO should be to provide individuals impacted by the protocol the ability to have a voice in shaping and governing it. What I appreciate about the delegate system is that it allows anyone the ability to say "I want my votes to be counted, but I don't have the bandwidth to make informed decisions, so I'm entrusting ___ to do so on my behalf."

## Rationale
The term for H2 2023 members has expired and we need to add new members to BFC. Need a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.

## New BFC Members
Going forward BFC members should be able to effectively communicate development and audit plans and timelines. We will support paying these contributors so long as they effectively keep communicating with farmers.
