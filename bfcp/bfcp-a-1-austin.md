## Background

I was previously a software engineer and worked in a variety of engineering and sales roles at multiple startups prior to contributing to Beanstalk.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

**Governance:**
* [Authored or co-authored all BFPs since exploit bar BFP-66](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth) (i.e., BFPs 67-81). Authoring proposals involved significant project management work, whether it was figuring out the details of the[ No Haircuts proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xb87854d7f6f40f0877a1333028eab829b213fbcce03f16f9dd3832c8a98ab99b), gathering the right people together to determine the[ Curve A parameter](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xbb1db9c60534b7aa3951ea0d7b107f755d555acdd95c495388be7a1bd7f494e0) to propose,[ designing the structure of the BFC](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0x3bf1e9ea8167019635787f44662096a1747b44f17c5e1571e33506d34453e889) to be as permissionless as possible, etc.
* Co-authored the[ BIP-20](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0xe47741c4bfa4ac97ad23bbec0db8b9a5f2efc3e1737b309476d90611698193f4) and[ BIP-21](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/72) writeups.
* Managed comms with the DAO and community when it came to particular governance proposals and soliciting/integrating community feedback.

**Content:**
* Project managed[ the Farmers’ Almanac](https://docs.bean.money/) from inception to launch.
* Authored significant portions of the Farmers’ Almanac and reviewed it in full.
* Wrote guides like[ A Farmer’s Guide to the Barn Raise](https://bean.money/blog/a-farmers-guide-to-the-barn-raise) and[ How to Purchase Fertilizer](https://bean.money/blog/how-to-purchase-fertilizer).
* Reviewed [all blog posts](https://bean.money/blog) published by Beanstalk Farms since the exploit.
* Wrote tooltips and copy across the [Beanstalk UI](https://app.bean.money/) (most of which will be seen once the new UI is fully launched at Replant).
* Miscellaneous copy work like writing scripts for [the Barn Raise video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srnhtH0dZgg) drafting announcements and tweets, etc.
* Although not directly part of my Beanstalk Farms work, I’ve also written [a](https://mirror.xyz/astn.eth/LeuGtteOh8N0GVHwuPL4R1TIPXmjQuZQFzGObCLezUM) [few](https://mirror.xyz/astn.eth/w5336TYVkb-9eIlKxrCPKLoUNvYRgJmd6nB4Br5-Vs8) [articles](https://mirror.xyz/astn.eth) about Beanstalk on my [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/astn.eth).

**Fundraising:**
* Brokered introductions to multiple investment funds post-exploit.

**Operations:**
* Worked closely with the frontend design/engineering teams, giving feedback and answering questions about new Beanstalk functionality to account for.
* Contributed to the creation of and maintained the[ Beanstalk Learning Center](https://bean.money/learning-center).
* Regularly managed meeting recordings when necessary.

## Role

My role post-exploit has primarily been 3 things that I intend on continuing to execute on as Governance Operations Lead: 

* Project managing and authoring various governance proposals; serving as a liaison between Beanstalk Farms and the rest of the DAO as it pertains to governance proposals, upcoming plans, etc.
* Creating (and managing the creation of) content like guides, blog posts, etc.; maintaining the Farmers’ Almanac as new Beanstalk functionality is shipped and the Beanstalk ecosystem grows—I plan to hire writers to help me with this work ASAP.
* Given my deep knowledge of Beanstalk, I plan to continue spending a fair amount of my time doing general “quality control” of Beanstalk Farms’ output. This has manifested in a handful of ways like feedback on the Beanstalk UI, reviewing various content like the upcoming disclosures statement, etc.

I also see my role as a bit of a catch-all for general operations as it pertains to the DAO, Beanstalk Farms, etc. To name just a few examples, I plan on:

* Managing the process for budget planning and the proposal of the quarterly budget BIPs;
* Managing the process for the Beanstalk Farms Retroactive Payment Proposal as described in [BFP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xa24c368f08093b8a5e27c0b3ae9296eb60272cddc8882434b02a86152d903e59) under _BFRPP Changes Rationale_;
* Maintaining the active list of contributors as described in [BFP-80](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0x3bf1e9ea8167019635787f44662096a1747b44f17c5e1571e33506d34453e889);
* Setting up and maintaining the various Snapshot pages related to Beanstalk governance; 
* Hiring an Operations Associate to manage the meeting recording process (recording meetings, uploading to Anchor/YouTube/etc, putting timestamps on the YouTube videos, maintaining the Beanstalk Learning Center, etc.); 
* Hiring Content Writers to work on blog posts; and
* Generally doing what needs to get done for Beanstalk to succeed and to build a well-functioning organization within Beanstalk Farms.

## Payment

20,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
