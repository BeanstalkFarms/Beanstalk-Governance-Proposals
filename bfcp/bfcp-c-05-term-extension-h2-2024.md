**Voting choices (For)**

* Extend Rex's term

## Proposal

According to Beanstalk Farms governance, at least 3 BFC members must approve any spending of the Beanstalk Farms budget. BFC members have term lengthsâ€”currently, Rex and mod323's terms end at the end of September 2024 and guy and sweetredbeans' terms end at the end of December 2024.

Therefore, in order to continue facilitating an efficient use of the remaining Beanstalk Farms budget, BFCP-C-5 is proposed.

Currently, Rex is the only BFC member that is paid by Beanstalk Farms (in accordance with [BFCP-A-16](https://arweave.net/HhOwYuvz2a3cWt-_KQjf6sWMaD8qZpzRJmL-fw5O3qs)).
