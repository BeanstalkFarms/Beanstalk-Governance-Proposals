## Summary

Add Silo Chad to the Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC) and hire them as Frontend Engineering Lead.

## Background

I am a software engineer. I worked in several engineering and operations roles at startups and venture capital funds prior to contributing to Beanstalk.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

**Engineering:**
* Upgraded and maintained [Beanstalk UI v1](https://pre-exploit-beanstalk-ui.netlify.app/) from January 2022 through April 2022. A changelog is available in **#ui-updates** on Discord. Notable upgrades included:
    * The Farmers Market;
    * [Support for wallets besides Metamask](https://twitter.com/BeanstalkFarms/status/1509962212290576384), including WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger;
    * Support for the BEAN:3CRV pool and the BEAN:LUSD pool; and
    * Various performance and UX improvements.
* Designed the [bean.money](https://bean.money/) landing page; led a small team of engineers to build it.
* Developed several iterations of the Barn Raise UI throughout April and May as the Path Forward plan was undergoing development. This includes the final version of the [Barn Raise](https://app.bean.money) which was finalized in [BFP-72](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xb87854d7f6f40f0877a1333028eab829b213fbcce03f16f9dd3832c8a98ab99b) and launched on June 6.
* Built [Beanstalk UI v2](https://app.bean.money/) from scratch to accommodate the Replant, Unripe assets, and new Beanstalk features. A live demo is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE358B9OagM). Notable features include:
    * Support for Beanstalk’s farm() functionality, allowing complex chaining of actions within Beanstalk and via the Depot. Engineered a new library for interacting with Beanstalk in this generalized fashion.
    * Support for Unripe assets within the Silo, as well as Pick and Chop functionality.
    * Support for purchasing Fertilizer and Rinsing Rinsable Sprouts after Replant.
    * A new design.
    * Performant loading of Farmers’ balances and Beanstalk analytics from multiple data sources.
    * Support for viewing the Beanstalk UI on mobile devices.
    * Support for viewing the Beanstalk UI without a wallet connected.
* Designed a new schema for the Beanstalk subgraph, taking into account changes proposed in BIP-21—this will serve as a foundation for the subgraph used by the Beanstalk UI and other projects that build on top of Beanstalk.

**Operations:**
* Guided conversations amongst DAO members and the Beanstalk Farms team, which unfolded into Beanstalk Farms’ [Path Forward](https://bean.money/blog/path-forward) plan.
* Led daily standups with Beanstalk Farms to execute on the Path Forward.
* Hosted DAO meetings; communicated Beanstalk Farms’ plans with the Beanstalk community.
* Managed a number of Beanstalk Farms’ tools and platforms.

## Role

Continue engineering the Beanstalk UI and Beanstalk SDKs. Post-Replant work will include (among other things):
* An improved Pod Market interface that introduces charts and other visuals;
* Expanded support for the Farm within DeFi;
* Support for new liquidity pools as they’re ratified by the Beanstalk DAO;
* A unified Governance page to aggregate Snapshot proposals and other governance conversations;
* Release of Barn Raise NFTs;
* Open-sourcing of the website and the Beanstalk SDK, which allows anyone to compose and execute transactions through the Farm;
* Reintroduction of on-chain governance if ratified by the DAO;
* Support for new Beanstalk protocol upgrades;Write technical and non-technical documentation for the Farmers’ Almanac related to the Beanstalk UI and other components; andExpand and coordinate Beanstalk Farms’ engineering team; develop a plan to allow continued development and maintenance of Beanstalk’s code in a decentralized fashion.

Generally, I am here to do whatever Beanstalk needs to succeed, whether in engineering, operations, or other capacity.

## Payment

30,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
