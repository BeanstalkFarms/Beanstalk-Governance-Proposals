## Proposer
Beanstalk Farmer

## Summary
Unban Harry Smiuff immediately.

## Problem
Is Beanstalk a DINO (decentralized in name only)? Is this truly decentralized if devs are banning core community members that are asking tough questions? If the devs and founders truly want to make this decentralized, they should put up any bans for a vote.

Also, unclear if this a BIP, BOP, BOOP, BFP, BFCP or any other one. The devs have made it very difficult to propose or change anything so I will try them all.

## Effective
Immediately upon these devs using some common sense.
