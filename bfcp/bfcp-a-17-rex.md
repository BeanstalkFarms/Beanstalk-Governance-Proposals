Most recently, the BFC has started banning members who are noting all the self-dealing and liquidity draining going on at the Farm.

The farm needs a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors. **UPDATE: Coincidentally, we did get some updates and discussion regarding the RFCs at the same time the team whipped up a new budget proposal.** It seems the only time the team wants to provide updates is when they want to extract value from the community.

In addition, several bot operators (some whom are in direct contact and affiliated with H2 2023 BFC members) have direct knowledge of development timelines and product development that help maximize their current stakes while keeping this information hidden from the broader farmer community to react and operate on the same playing field.

## Proposer
Beanstalk Farmer (Per the BFC minions, explicit approval is needed. "Harry Smiuff" has given explicit approval through another farmer. "Harry Smiuff" can confirm on Discord assuming the insiders unban)

## Summary
Add "Harry Smiuff" to the BFC. 

## Quorum Note
Quorum is 25% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.

## Voting Choices
- Add "Harry Smiuff" to BFC
- Don't Add "Harry Smiuff" to BFC

## Background
The Farm needs an outside independent member that is willing to communicate with the broader community. The H2 2023 BFC failed to engage with the community and have not been transparent with the current development timelines and audits.

## Proposal
Considering the H2 2023 BFC teams members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community and have no timelines, this BFCP is proposed to add a "Harry Smiuff" as a BFC member. He/him/they is an active member of the community and was recently banned for calling out all the self dealing on the Farm. 

## Rationale
The term for H2 2023 members has expired and we need to add new members to BFC. Need a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently, all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.

## Payment
Harry Smiuff has noted that he does not want any payment for his services. He understands that the existing liquidity is important to the rugged farmers and should not continue to get exploited by the devs or contributors who already been paid a substantial sum.
