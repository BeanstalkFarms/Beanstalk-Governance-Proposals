## Proposer

Beanstalk Farms Committee

## Summary

Extend the terms of current BFC members.

## Quorum Note

Quorum is 25% of the Stalk supply participating in the vote.

There are 3 voting choices, and each represents voting For a BFC member's proposal. Abstaining from a voting choice while voting For any other choices is equivalent to voting against. Quorum and a majority vote For is required for a BFC member’s proposal to pass.

**Voting choices (For)**

* Extend guy's term
* Extend Silo Chad's term
* Extend sweetredbeans' term

## Proposal

Each BFC member's term currently ends at the end of Q3 2023. A BFC member’s proposal passing extends their term to the end of Q4 2023.

> Note: mod323 currently remains a BFC member in order to advise on hiring, marketing and other projects, but no longer takes payment from Beanstalk Farms, and thus is not submitting a renewal proposal.
