## Proposer

Rex (rexthebean.eth)

## Summary

Add Rex to the Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC) and hire them as Communications Lead.

## Background

I have nearly ten years of formal leadership experience and am currently a senior contract negotiator at a Fortune 500 energy company. Past roles have involved leading teams of frontline hourly employees, specialized individual contributors, and professional engineers. Prior to my energy experience, I was the founding director of a satellite campus of a small local college, managing staff and faculty while serving the needs of students.

My academic background is in history and political science and I also hold an MBA.

Along with being a long-time Farmer, in 2022 I held the role of Department Head for the Beanstalk Farms Community Team from February until after the exploit and hosted nearly 40 episodes of The Bean Pod and RadioDeFi podcasts. I also currently serve as a Stalk delegate and post updates on Discord on how I am voting. 

## Motivations

I'm genuinely excited about the plans that Beanstalk Farms has for the rest of 2024. The projects outlined in [BIP-39](https://arweave.net/9DZrP_OJEDM_a-GH_8AFxTaiUz91ya8lK6KhELO5Ekc) are innovative and make Beanstalk more robust, interesting, and safe.

However, it seems clear that the community is in interested in bringing back the DAO meetings in some form with increased communication about development and audit timelines - a role I am happy to help out with.

## Role

I will view my role as Community Lead to primarily:
* Host monthly DAO meetings where contributors have an opportunity to share updates;
* Answer questions in the Discord about expected development and audit timelines;
* Communicate changes about those timelines;
* Etc. 

I also expect there will be plenty of unanticipated work on this front that is difficult to document in this proposal in advance.

Beanstalk finds itself in a healthy position and I am excited to see how the Farm develops over the coming year, particularly when the community has a bit more clarity around progress and timelines.

## Payment

3,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month (1,500 per payment, conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

Note that if this proposal passes, I will relinquish my role as a Stalk delegate, as I don't believe it's appropriate for someone being paid by the DAO to be voting on behalf of others.

## Commitment

Part-time (~20 hr/wk).
