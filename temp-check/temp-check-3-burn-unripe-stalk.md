## Summary

There has been some [discussion in the Beanstalk community](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1221190286789578792/1221190286789578792) about potentially burning Stalk associated with Unripe Deposits given that there is little need for Beanstalk to pay Unripe holders to Deposit or hold Stalk in the Silo. Less Unripe Stalk could potentially make the Silo more attractive to new Depositors.

In Temp-Check-3, the DAO has the opportunity to express a preference for whether or not Unripe Stalk should be burned.

## Process Note

This temperature check proposal is intended for the DAO to express a preference in advance of a future BIP. There is no quorum for this proposal given that the goal is to simply gather information and feedback. Stalkholders are still strongly encouraged to participate in order for the outcome of the vote to be as representative as possible. The vote will last 7 days.

## Voting Choices

Voting For is to express interest in burning all Unripe Stalk. Voting Against is to express interest against doing so.

* For
* Against

## Considerations

See the [discussion channel in the Beanstalk Discord](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1221190286789578792/1221190286789578792) for more information.

Some considerations in favor of burning Unripe Stalk:

* Beanstalk has little (or nothing) to gain from incentivizing Silo Members to keep Unripe Deposits in the Silo;
* This would increase the incentive for new Deposits in the Silo;
* Even if this change increases the attractiveness of Chopping, Chopping benefits Beanstalk in the form of decreased Unripe obligations;
* etc.

Some consideration in favor of not significantly decreasing the Unripe Seed rewards:

* There could be consequences associated with having holders of BDV in the Silo with no Stalk, related to there being a significant portion of liquidity that has less incentive to Convert than before;
* It is unclear what effect this will have on governance;
* etc.
