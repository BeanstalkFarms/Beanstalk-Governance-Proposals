Beanstalk Farms

## Summary

There has been [much](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1024499666311708712/1024499666311708712) [discussion](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1105925045294993459/1105927525789618216) in the Beanstalk community about the incentives for converting Unripe assets. In [Temp-Check-1](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xd47bc5099839f79e1d5ba0870d5c5ffff6ab416787c3ddca69d8500d9877e8e1), the DAO expressed a preference for setting the Seeds per BDV rewards for urBEAN (Unripe Bean) and urBEAN3CRV (Unripe BEAN:3CRV LP) to be equal. 

In Temp-Check-2, the DAO has the opportunity to express a preference for what the urBEAN and urBEAN3CRV Seed rewards should both be set to (they are currently set to 2 and 4, respectively).

## Process Note

This temperature check proposal is intended for the DAO to express a preference in advance of the Silo V3 BIP. Ultimately, as the future proposer of the BIP, Beanstalk Farms reserves the right to set the Unripe Seed rewards in the BIP to any values.

Given that this proposal is simply for Beanstalk Farms to gather information, there is no quorum. Stalkholders are still strongly encouraged to participate in order for the outcome of the vote to be as representative as possible. The vote will last 7 days.

## Voting Choices

Given that the DAO expressed interest in Unripe Seeds Parity, what should the Unripe Seed rewards both be set to? (Currently their Seeds per BDV rewards and 2 and 4, respectively.)

* 0 Seeds
* 0.5 Seeds
* 1 Seed
* 1.5 Seeds
* 2 Seeds

## Considerations

See the discussion channel in the Beanstalk Discord for more information.

Some considerations in favor of significantly decreasing the Unripe Seed rewards (even to zero):

- Beanstalk has little (or nothing) to gain from incentivizing Silo Members to keep Unripe Deposits in the Silo;
- This would increase the incentive for new Deposits in the Silo;
- Even if low or zero Seeds marginally increase the attractiveness of Chopping, Chopping benefits Beanstalk in the form of decreased Unripe obligations;
- etc.

Some consideration in favor of not significantly decreasing the Unripe Seed rewards:

- It will potentially make it more difficult to pass a BIP that significantly decreases the Unripe Seed rewards given that currently most Stalk comes from Unripe Deposits (although the purpose of this vote is to gather feedback and align the DAO in advance of the Silo V3 BIP, such that the Unripe Seeds change creates as little friction as possible);
- etc.
