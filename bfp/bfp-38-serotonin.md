## Summary

Fund an engagement with Serotonin for Q1 2022 from the Beanstalk Farms budget.

## Reasoning

Serotonin is a breakthrough marketing firm and product studio for web3. With a team of former executives from ConsenSys, Chainlink, General Assembly, and more, Serotonin has worked with protocols like Ampleforth, Arweave, Alchemy and Cosmos on brand positioning, business partnerships, media relations, content, product marketing, and go-to-market strategy. They combine expertise in financial services, digital assets, and decentralized tech with data-driven methodology to ensure their partners’ marketing is executed flawlessly, driving step-function growth. 

## Details of Engagement

Beanstalk Farms will be supported by Serotonin’s various teams for content marketing, growth marketing and public relations executing against multiple different strategies. We will work collaboratively with their channel owners and experts, applying best practices and processes gleaned from years of growing marketing functions. Together Serotonin’s team will work side by side with the Beanstalk Farms Marketing team on a uniform growth approach. Specifically, Serotonin will be responsible for:

**Content Marketing**
• Build out a full content calendar including long-tail SEO content to promote discoverability;
• Copy for websites, decks, and other assets; and longform op-eds and blogs posts for both owned blogs and external syndication; and
• Provide full support on content writing and on optimal distribution.

**Product Marketing**
• Establish, manage and help improve the Beanstalk marketing funnel;
• Establish that the funnel is working properly, that analytics are in place, and that calls to action funnel visitors toward doing what we care about most; and
• Work back from our agreed-upon business OKRs.

**Community**
• Help build and highly engaged community on Twitter, Discord, Reddit and other social channels;
• Create and implement community strategies based on best practices; and
• Collect the most relevant channels for users, and driving growth to meet agreed-upon targets.

**Growth Marketing**

Cointelegraph, Decrypt and the top Defi Podcasts;
• Continuously execute media strategy, including releases, pitches, op-ed placements, event speaking, and interview prep; and
• Exposing Beanstalk Farms to the right individuals and outlets.
