## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Pay GuavAnom for graphic design consultancy, assistance, and creation of Beanstalk’s revamped logo, logo typeface, and a foundational brand style guide.

## Resume

GuavAnom is a senior graphic designer and consultant. GuavAnom focuses primarily on visual identity to build stronger identifiable brands. Personally referred by deezbeanz.

## Project Definition:

Beanstalk Farm’s internal Design department is heavily understaffed and help is needed to *quickly* create pivotal foundational design documents at a high level of fidelity.

Beanstalk is currently undergoing a massive visual identity revamp. To help align the visual identity and theme, Beanstalk needs a basic foundational brand style guide that contains all the elements to craft a true and consistent Beanstalk experience.

This basic style guide should include at minimum:

- Revamped Logo and Logo typeface
- Logo Guidelines
- Revised Color Palette & Color Guidelines
- Typography Guidelines
- Spacing & Layout Guidelines
- Visual Asset Library
- Strong “Do nots”

A strong and well branded style guide should allow internal teams to create content that is unified and cohesive. A version of this style guide should be available for external vendors to give guidance on how to stay within Beanstalk branding as well as how to use Beanstalk assets. A simplified version of this style guide should be made public for general users to understand the overall Beanstalk visual branding. This style guide should be extremely clear and user friendly. It should focus on showing how to use individual elements rather than only portraying finished products to allow for creative freedom of users. Not only will this document be a visual compass and guide, it should serve as a source of inspiration for new Beanstalk creative products and content.

Examples of industry standard style guides:

Note* Due to project constraints (budget and time), this first style guide will only lay the foundations and will need further specific development by Beanstalk Farm’s Design department after initial completion.

## Payment

Pay GuavAnom a one time initial payment of 5,000 Beans upon passage of proposal, and a one time final payment of 10,000 Beans upon successful completion of the project. In total 15,000 Beans.

Project will need approval by the Design manager and Publius before final payment is issued.

## Commitment

Rush job.

## Target deadline range

2-3 weeks from agreement with flexibility upon Design manager’s discretion
