## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Hire 0xaustin (ongoing) as Part-time Bean Stenographer through Q1 2022. 

## Resume

0xaustin is a software developer by trade and most recently worked as a sales engineer at a startup. He has been taking excellent notes for the DAO for the last 12 weeks which can be reviewed [here](https://www.notion.so/a57619dbe75449968859db7f4fa2936f). In his day job, he takes notes all day during his job while on calls with customers and has written plenty of internal documentation to help teams scale.

## Role Definition

The Bean Stenographer is responsible for taking detailed, consistent minutes from meetings, A&T University classes, and other events and critical meetings of the DAO. Prior to having a formal stenographer role, various members of the DAO had been requesting notes from meetings that they could not attend, and without having a dedicated person to take notes the response has been spotty and inconsistent. 0xaustin has been bringing the organization of Beanstalk Farms to the next level and his continued role as Stenographer will support the continued organization of the DAO. 

## Payment

300 beans per week through Q1 2022.  

## Commitment

Part-time (5 hours per week) through the end of Q1 2022. To be renewed and potentially expanded in Q2 2022.
