## Proposal

Hire pfdrake88 as a part-time Event Lead in the Community Department

## Resume

Pfdake88 has had significant experience in the finance sector; specifically in the realms of retail consumer and commercial banking. With a degree in Behavioral Sciences focusing on Counseling, he has an understanding of the inner-workings of people and is able to connect well with others, build relationships, and lead with influence and credibility.  He has also had other sales and outreach experience that has led to profitability for the organizations he has represented.

Throughout his experience and career, pfdrake88 has led teams and organized events to further the exposure of various organizations including non-profits, retail businesses and financial institutions.  He has spearheaded the development and implementation of multi-vendor events, equipping teams, facilitating giveaways and analyzing effectiveness of those efforts to further organizational development and growth.  Strong relationship and customer service skills have allowed him to be an asset to the teams he has been involved in by promoting organizations and providing thorough knowledge.

Through the Discord community and personal experience with Beanstalk, pfdrake88 has been able to grow in his understanding of the DAO and see the strengths and uniqueness that Beanstalk offers. He has sown Beans, engaged with more experienced farmers, and has involved himself in the Discord server to glean further knowledge and understanding of the protocol specifically and crypto currency as a whole. Through the recent Beans-on-the-Table Poker Tournament, pfdrake88 has also become familiar with the mission of Beanstalk to increase exposure to the crypto-community.

## Role Definition

The Events Lead will coordinate and execute opportunities for the Beanstalk community to come together, build camaraderie, and develop a better understanding of one another and the protocol. Though many of the projects that the Events Lead will be working on will be lighthearted in nature, the overarching goal is far more meaningful - to create an environment where farmers of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge of the protocol feel welcome and appreciated.

The Events Lead will be responsible for internal and external events. Internal events will include, but not be limited to:

- Beans on the Table poker tournaments;
- Guess the Beans contests;
- Farmer of the Month awards;
- Beans in the Wild contests;
- Beanstalk A&T University giveaways; and
- Others as opportunities arise.

External events will include coordinating Beanstalk's presence (physical appearances, Publius' "appearances," happy hours, podcast recordings, etc.) at events like, but not limited to:

- ETH Denver;
- ETH NYC;
- The Great American Bitcoin Conference; and
- Others as opportunities arise.

## Commitment and Compensation

Part time (15+ hours per week) commitment in return for 2,400 Beans per month, paid every two weeks, through the end of Q2 2022. At will.
