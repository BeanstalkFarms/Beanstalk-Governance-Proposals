Dumpling

## Proposal

Hire 2bean (or not 2bean) (ongoing) as Part-time Bean Stenographer through Q2 2022.

## Resume

2bean (or not 2bean) is the Chief of Staff at a fintech startup in his full-time job. He has taken over Stenographer duties from 0xaustin (on 0xaustinâ€™s recommendation) for the last 3 weeks, and he has been taking excellent notes over this time period, all of which can be reviewed here: ([https://www.notion.so/a57619dbe75449968859db7f4fa2936f?v=a2eaf7819c4d4aeabad622b7612b91c6](https://www.notion.so/a57619dbe75449968859db7f4fa2936f)). In his day job, he takes notes on high-level company strategy meetings and is relied upon to condense complex discussions into concise formats.

## Role Definition

The Bean Stenographer is responsible for taking detailed, consistent minutes from meetings, A&T University classes, and other events and critical meetings of the DAO. Prior to having a formal stenographer role, various members of the DAO had been requesting notes from meetings that they could not attend, and without having a dedicated person to take notes the response has been spotty and inconsistent. 0xaustin had taken on this role previously and is transitioning into another role where he can work on content creation and marketing for Beanstalk. In his place, he has recommended 2bean (or not 2bean) to take over Stenographer duties.

## Payment

1300 beans per month, paid bimonthly, starting on 1/10/2022, through Q2 2022.

## Commitment

Part-time (minimum of 5 hours per week) through the end of Q2 2022. At-will. To be renewed and potentially expanded in Q3 2022.
