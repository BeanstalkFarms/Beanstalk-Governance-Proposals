## Proposer

Dumpling

## Summary

Fund a two month CRE8R DAO marketing campaign with 50,000 beans from the Q1 2022 Beanstalk Farms budget.

## Reasoning

CRE8R DAO has a strong history of assisting early stage DeFi protocols in increasing awareness, recruiting new users, and educating participants on the mechanics and benefits of various protocols. As the previous Beanstalk CRE8R DAO campaign was a tremendous success, Beanstalk Farms proposes to further collaborate with CRE8R DAO’s network of content creators and influencers. The goal of this engagement is to drive user growth for Beanstalk and demand for Beans. 

This engagement will include, but is not limited to:

- A dedicated project manager with weekly strategy calls
- Direct engagement with Beanstalk
- High Production Value Motion Video
- Infographics
- Design support
- Beanstalk features on creator platforms
- Beanstalk Youtuber features on channels with 5-15K subscribers
- Advocacy from popular Crypto Twitter accounts

Although CRE8R DAO and Beanstalk will be operating under CRE8R’s Standard Agreement, they intend to use this engagement as means to deepen their relationship and pave the way for further integrations. CRE8R has expressed willingness to pay its creators in $BEAN and to find other ways of encouraging the use of $BEAN as a stablecoin. 

## Proposed Budget

50,000 Beans from the Q1 2022 Beanstalk Farms budget, paid in 25,000 bean installments. First payment will be delivered following approval of BFP-27.
