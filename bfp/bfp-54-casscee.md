## Proposal

Hire CassCee as a part-time Social Media Lead in the Community Department.

## Resume

CassCee is pivoting into the Web3/defi space after having a successful career in the cosmetology industry where, in addition to customer service, they also fulfilled various leadership, educational, and social media management responsibilities. That experience afforded CassCee an immense amount of insight into leveraging social media platforms to establish valuable connections, effectively communicate, expand brand/personal outreach and build an organic following.

Critically, their experience led to an appreciation for the importance of knowing your audience to provide quality, engaging content that properly represents a brand or ones personal values in a way that is relatable and easily understood.

Not having an original background in tech (but understanding crypto) helps them to be able to explain protocols in a manner that can be easily understood by new users. Because of that, in addition to their active participation in the Beanstalk Discord and Beanstalk Twitter Army, they have a solid, likeminded following that includes several prominent accounts within the Defi community. You can find them on a large number of Discord servers as CassCee and on Twitter as @0xBased_
