Pay stolenhamburger retroactively for his work as a designer at Beanstalk for past ~1.5 months.

Here are the initiatives stolenhamburger has worked on:

**Recruiting:**

**Partnerships:**

**Misc:**

Stolenhamburger believes it was important to under-promise and over-deliver, which is why he asks for retroactive compensation rather than forward looking compensation. They understand the risk that this may pose, but theyâ€™d rather not get paid than possibly overpromise in any way. They also are aligned with the long term growth of the protocol and wish the beans to be sown.

## Payment

10,000 Sown Beans for previous work

## Commitment

Stolenhamburger will continue to help Beanstalk and will request payment after completing work in similar fashion going forward.
