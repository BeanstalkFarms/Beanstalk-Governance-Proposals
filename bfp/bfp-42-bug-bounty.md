## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Pay a bug bounty to shehzleen for his discovery of a small but potentially hazardous website vulnerability.  

## Reasoning

shehzleen reached out to Publius with a vulnerability and a solution. As Beanstalk Farmsâ€™s formal Bug Bounty program is not yet live, we have offered shehzleen 7500 beans for their efforts. 

## Bug

A problem with the DMARC record for [bean.money](http://bean.money) allowed for phishing emails to be sent from @bean.money email addresses without authorization. The issue has been resolved.

## Payment

7500 beans as a bug bounty. Upon snapshot approval funds will be distributed to shehzleen.
