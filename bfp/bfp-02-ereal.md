## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Hire Ereal as Written Content Lead Editor 

## Resume

ereal works in finance, specializing in helping PE and VC firms fundraise. His experience spans project management, client relationship management, and materials creation and is excited to bring some of those skills to Beanstalk.

Prior to formally joining the DAO, he created a Beanstalk infographic to help educate new users about the protocol and also collaborated with Kyamites (aka JWW) on a Zero to Beanstalk project to help people with no experience in crypto onboard to Beanstalk in a simple, step-by-step process.

## Role Definition

At this stage in the DAO’s growth trajectory, it is critical to develop a compelling, cohesive voice for communicating both internally and externally. Having a common parlance will benefit the community in a number of ways, including: (1) ensuring that all outbound Beanstalk communications are consistent; (2) having pithy one-liners to concisely advertise the protocol; (3) easing the onboarding of new users in the Discord with brief, off-the-shelf answers to common questions; and (4) solidifying that media / potential partners view associate our brand with legitimacy and organizational sophistication.

ereal plans to help lead these efforts by spearheading and initiating a number of projects such as:

- Serving as Lead Editor on all copy produced by Beanstalk Farms and the Silo.
- Writing a weekly newsletter that recaps recent protocol activity and DAO initiatives, and provides helpful links to relevant content (like the stablecoin industry pieces that DAO members share from time to time).
- Periodically writing more formal Medium pieces that serve as business updates and analysis pieces. This would include official announcements of recently-passed BIPs/budgets/etc. and thought pieces like Nasjaq’s Road to One Billion Beans which are fantastic but currently not polished enough for external publication.
- Developing a set of go-to marketing phrases for describing Beanstalk. This would include things like how we explain the protocol to the outside world in one line: “A decentralized, collateral-free, credit-based stablecoin” (recognizing that this particular example is a very minor iteration of the White Paper’s title).
- Writing a simpler FAQ and perhaps create a dedicated channel in Discord to house it. Bean Merchant’s document is great, but it’s likely a bit too extensive to hold the average new user’s attention. This bullet speaks to a broader point that ereal’s role will focus on; that being to help to “pithify” Beanstalk’s language. Doing so will only become increasingly important as the protocol onboards more and more low-involvement Farmers who want to understand the Silo and Field enough to use them, but not enough to dig into the mechanics.
- Drafting a stock cover note for biz dev and media outreach.
- Acting as the Editor for outbound DAO communications.

## Payment

4,800 beans per month, paid bimonthly. 

Ereal has been working for the DAO in a part-time, project basis since November 28th, 2021. 2400 Beans retroactive payment to be made upon approval for this work. 

## Commitment

Minimum 20 hours/week through March 31st, 2022. To be renewed upon approval of Q2 Budget.
