## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Hire jakerb as part-time Product Manager

## Resume

jakerb is a product manager at an early-stage startup and has helped the product scale through various stages of funding. He also has experience in venture, as a contributor in other DAO, as well as owning the product as a co-founder of a social-focused startup that raised tens of thousands of dollars. He has part-time availability for now with the hope that he becomes a full-time contributor. Beanpilled by early contributors like 0xaustin, he’s been an active member in the community and has already contributed to the Pod Marketplace and Curve integration. Previously, Publius, Dumpling, and the Eng Leads were tasked with all product/project oversight but as the DAO grows this won’t be scalable. We look to jakerb as highly qualified to assist us as we reach new heights.

## Role Definition

Product Manager Lead. Beanstalk Product Manager Lead is a new role. As best described by Publius, "making sure every team has what they need from every other team” is core to the role. Given how quickly the DAO is scaling and the many moving parts (engineering, UX, marketing, copy, community, etc.) it will be critical that every project meets the original spec, deadline, and all parties involved are both unblocked themselves and not blocking others. Jakerb has shown that he’s organized, an effective communicator, and has great initiative. As more projects have their own point person, we hope jakerb can become responsible for more things at a project level and including coordinating and ensuring things are moving smoothly across the entire DAO.

## Payment

1100 Beans per week, through the end of Q1. To be reviewed and re-approved for Q2. 

## Commitment

Part-time (A minimum of 20 hours per week).
