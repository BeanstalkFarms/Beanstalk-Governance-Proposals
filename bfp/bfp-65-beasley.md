## Proposal

Hire Beasley as a part-time back end developer in the Engineering Department and pay him retroactively for his work at Beanstalk Farms in Q1 2022. Status to change to full-time on May 15th. 

## Resume

Beasley studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in college before working in DeFi. He also has experience in penetration testing and exploit development and thus recognizes developer best practices for writing smart contracts.

Beasley worked as a back end developer at Beanstalk farms through the end of Q4, helping with efficiency improvements and gas optimization. During his time here in Q1, Beasley wrote the logic for part of Beanstalk’s Curve integration, generalized function calls, and LUSD trove functionality. Beasley has experience with creating and deploying smart contracts from scratch, and wishes to continue working on Beanstalk cross-contract, specifically by increasing Beanstalk’s presence in other facets of DeFi as a native stablecoin primitive.

## Role Definition

Moving forward, Beasley will specifically focus on back end development on the Beanstalk diamond, which includes:

- Writing and implementing code to be segmented and proposed as future BIPs.
- Assisting Publius with on-ramping new back end developers.
- Working with other protocols to further increase Beanstalk’s versatility in DeFi.

## Payment

6,250 Beans per month until May 14th (12,000 Beans) 

12,500 Beans Per month from May 15th to the end of the Q2 for FT work (>40 hours/week)

Retroactive payment of 30,000 Beans for work completed in Q1 2020 to be paid upon approval of this snapshot. 

## Commitment

Part-time, >20 hours per week, starting on April 1, 2022, through May 14th, 2022. Then scales up to FT (>40 hours per week) from May 15th, 2022 until end of Q2 2022.  At-will.
