## Proposal

Hire Cool Bean as a Part-time Frontend Developer in the Engineering Department. 

## Resume

Cool Bean is a full-stack software engineer and will be joining the frontend team at Beanstalk. He spent the past couple years working as a software engineer at a FAANG company and doing web consulting projects for private companies.

## Role Definition

Cool Bean will work closely with Silo Chad on developing the frontend application. This will include re-architecting and implementing a new frontend codebase, optimizing page calls to
speed up latency, and organizing the existing code. This is important for both scalability and for open-sourcing at the end of Q1. Cool Bean will report to the Frontend Lead. 

## Payment

4500 Beans per month, paid bi-weekly, as of February 16th, 2022, though Q1 2022.

Part-time (15+ hours/week). At will. To be potentially expanded with mutual agreement in Q2 2022.
