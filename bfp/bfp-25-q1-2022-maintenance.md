## Proposer

Dumpling

## Summary

Allocate 25,000 Beans to cover Beanstalk Farms transaction costs including BIP proposals and payments.

## Problem

Issuing BIPs, upgrading the Subgraph and doing payroll is costly (larger transactions are upwards of ~$500 every time), and although the team has done creative things to reduce gas, Beanstalk Farms is need of a transaction cost budget to keep things running smoothly.

As usage of bean.money and the decentralized development team working on it grows, the infrastructure supporting it must grow as well. Good infrastructure is not free.

## Solution:

Allocate 25,000 Beans to cover these and similar costs through Q1 2022. This should help expedite upgrades to the subgraph and ensure timely payment to contributors.
