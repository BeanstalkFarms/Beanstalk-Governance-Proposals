## Summary

Purchase two type licenses from Oh no Type Co. for Beanstalk’s new creative direction.

## Reasoning

See BFP-37 for brand identity v2 snapshot where the fonts are featured. [https://www.notion.so/beanstalkfarmsdao/BFP-37-Brand-Identity-v2-59c9120edeff466195e4226d37443df7](https://www.notion.so/BFP-37-Brand-Identity-v2-59c9120edeff466195e4226d37443df7)

## Use

The new typefaces will be used in all products developed by Beanstalk Farms such as the new logo, website, documentation, marketing material, educational content, etc. 

## Licensing agreement

Beanstalk Farms needs both desktop and web retail licenses for the typefaces “*Obviously*” and “*Degular*” from OH no Type Co. 

Visit here for details on OH no’s desktop and web licensing.

## Budget

Beanstalk Farms will need $5,090 to license the two font families at the following user levels and desktop & web license at the lowest tier.

Obviously Complete Family
500k monthly page views

- 13-18 Users
- $2,995

Degular Complete Family
500k monthly page views

- 13-18 Users
- $2,095

This purchase will last permanently, until Beanstalk Farms needs to upgrade due to additional traffic or users. In case of an upgrade, Beanstalk Farms will only need to cover the delta between the current plan and the upgraded one.
