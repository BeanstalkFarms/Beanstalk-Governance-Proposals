## Proposal

Hire dalteco as a Content Strategist for the Copy Department

## Resume

Having entered crypto during the ERC-20 boom, dalteco has been involved with the Web3 ecosystem for more than 5 years. He’s fascinated by DeFi experiments and the decentralized economy growing from the miracle that is blockchain technology. 

Dalteco holds an undergraduate degree in Marketing and Finance from a top 10 business school in the US. He currently works full-time for a top 25 blockchain project (by market cap) as a content writer, where he leads the development of all types of content—from short-form social media copy and email blasts, to 3000+ word blog posts. His written content has been seen by millions, and he has extensive experience shaping a holistic brand voice. 

Dalteco first heard of Beanstalk in February 2022 through a Twitter post asking for the most innovative DeFi protocols. Since his first touch with Beanstalk, he has already contributed an article detailing his research journey regarding Beanstalk on his personal Medium blog—the first instance of his content contributions to the cause. 

## Role Definition

This part-time Content Strategist role reports to the Head of the Copy Department and will include:

- Editing and managing Beanstalk Farms blog content;
- Producing independent Medium content;
- Writing articles and blog posts about Beanstalk;
- Developing and documenting brand strategy and defining the voice of Beanstalk Farms copy in collaboration with the Marketing department; and
- Writing and maintaining the Copy Guide.

## Payment

3,900 Beans per month, paid twice a month, starting on March 15th, 2022.

## Commitment

Part-time (>15 hours per week). At-will.
