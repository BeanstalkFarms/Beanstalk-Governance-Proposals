## Proposal

Hire TBIQ as Data & Metrics Lead in the Engineering Department.

## Resume

TBIQ is an experienced machine learning engineer at a fintech company specializing in software engineering, full stack web development, data analytics, and data visualization. Recently, he has dove deep into the crypto rabbit hole and has been honing his skills as an on chain analyst. Prior to joining Beanstalk Farms, he has built the most comprehensive Beanstalk protocol dashboard on Dune Analytics to date.

## Role Definition

The Data & Metrics Lead will include the following responsibilities:
— Allocating time and resources within the Data & Metrics team to identify worthwhile projects and efforts, and drive them to completion.
— Lead coordination efforts between Data & Metrics and other engineering teams to ensure alignment so that all teams can move forward towards their objectives with clear goals and no cross team blockers.
— Build out a protocol monitoring dashboard for Beanstalk on Dune Analytics to allow both developers and users to gain a deeper understanding of Beanstalk. This includes new feature development as well as maintenance of previously implemented components.
— Creating a roadmap and documentation for the Dune Analytics dashboard effort to ensure all contributors have a clear idea of requirements and priorities.
— Working with the middleware team to help deliver the Beanstalk SDK.
— Help to design and implement new charting capabilities for bean.money.
— Develop a strategy for a convergence of Beanstalk’s analytical capabilities into a single location (eventually, bean.money).
— Represent for the Data & Metrics team at DAO meetings and reports directly to Publius.

## Payment

7700 beans per month, paid bimonthly, through the end of Q2 2022. Retroactive payment of 3850 beans for 2 weeks of work (at standard rate) prior to submission of snapshot proposal. 450 of the 7700 beans per month will be used for a dune analytics pro subscription.

## Commitment

Minimum of 20 hours/week. To be renewed in Q2 2022 and beyond if there is mutual interest. At-will.
