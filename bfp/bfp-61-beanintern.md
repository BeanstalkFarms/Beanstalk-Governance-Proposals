## Proposal

Hire BeanIntern as a part-time Metaverse Lead in the Community Team

## Resume

Beanintern was one of the earliest “Beanpilled” participants in the protocol, joining the server under the name Dutchbeans. They quickly gained an understanding of the protocol and began regularly interacting with Publius. Those interactions gave Intern a respect for Publius’ vision and unwillingness to compromise for short term hype. More seasoned farmers may remember BeanIntern’s early and regular garden postings, with the goal of fostering the vibe of friendly collaboration for which we are now know.

After significant time and work with Beanstalk early on, BeanIntern stepped away as their regular job demanded more and more of their time. Now having left that other obligation, they are able to focus their time on Beanstalk and will be working with both the Metaverse and Business Development teams.

BeanIntern has experience as a vibe curator at manifest and plays a leading role in Volt protocol. Some may also remember IndexDAO, a project which they helped launch over the Christmas holidays. Though the venture didn’t perform as expected, they learned a lot in the process and revel in the opportunity to grow, even through difficulties.

BeanIntern prides themselves on their strong skills in business development, community vibe, and generally ambitious approach. Specifically, they see the metaverse as a way to build a lore extension for the Beanstalk community. In the same way stories are told through song and rhymes, they want knowledge of Beanstalk to be told like stories and experiences, potentially through a variety of platforms, assets, and experiences.

BeanIntern’s metaverse research is ongoing and rooted in exploring a number of relevant Discord servers. Their vision for the Beanstalk metaverse project (a.k.a., the “MetaBean”) is for a gamified interface through Gather, but with addition aspects that tie to social good in the real world, as they believe this aspect could set the project apart. Upon approval from the DAO, their first order of business is to work together with other team members to develop a scoping and short-term execution plan for the project.

## Role Definition

The Metaverse Lead will facilitate the development of Beanstalk’s virtual interaction platform. The organization has three key goals for it’s metaverse program:

1. Community engagement and development;
2. Education; and
3. Facilitating Bean utilization.

Because of how early the organization is in its metaverse development, the first requirement of the Metaverse Lead will be to assess various platforms for the option that best fits the needs of the organization. In addition to existing platforms (e.g., Sandbox, Decentraland, GatherTown, etc.), the individual in this role may choose to work with independent developers to build a customized solution for Beanstalk.

Regardless of the platform chosen or developed, the Metaverse Lead will be responsible for identifying and incorporating systems and functions that help facilitate the three types of actives listed above. For example, an early goal will likely be to incorporate a virtual cardplaying system to allow for future poker tournaments to take place in the metaverse. Similarly, the Metaverse Lead will be responsible for developing spaces where small groups (Teams) and large groups (A&T University and the DAO) can meet and interact. Whenever possible and practical, Beans will be used as the medium of exchange in the metaverse system. 

Other possibilities, such as gamification and development of social-good initiatives will also be explored and developed when possible. The Metaverse Lead will work closely with peers from Operations, Engineering, and other parts of Beanstalk Farms to ensure organizational alignment and successful execution of the project.

## Payment

4,800 Beans per month, paid twice a month. Starting on April 1st, 2022. 

## Commitment

Part time (20+ hours per week), through the end of Q2, 2022. At-will.
