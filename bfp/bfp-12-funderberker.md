## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Hire funderberker as Lead Middleware Engineer for Beanstalk.

## Resume

funderberker is a member of the Beanstalk community who began working as an engineer in November. In that time, they have delivered the Discord and Telegram bots, as well as the Python Tooling. This proposal is to extend and update funderberker's contract. They will be assuming the position of Lead Middleware Engineer.

## Role Definition

Lead Middleware Engineer, which will include the following responsibilities:

- Allocating time and resources within the Middleware team efficiently across projects
- Coordinating with other teams, particularly the web dev team, to ensure success across the stack
- Designing and planning major Middleware projects
- Leading the development of the SDK
- Maintaining and updating of bots, as needed
- A major priority of the middleware team in Q1 will be the design and development of an SDK, which will:
- Efficiently gather and calculate state of the Beanstalk protocol
- Check an individual wallet's balances and perform Beanstalk operations on their behalf
- Interact with a variety of different liquidity pools through a standardized interface

The SDK will first be implemented in Typescript. It will draw information primarily from the Ethereum blockchain and the Beanstalk subgraphs with the goal of making all information relevant to Beanstalk accessible through a simple standardized interface. The first major consumer of the SDK will be the website, which is currently running state calculations using one-off logic on each page load. Implementing the SDK across the website will greatly simplify maintenance of the website and enable the web dev team to deploy faster.

## Payment

8645 Beans per month (1995 beans per week), paid bimonthly, through Q1 2022.

## Commitment

An average of 21 hours per week. If more hours are worked, then additional payment can be made as appropriate. At-will. To be renewed in Q2 2022 if there is mutual interest at the time.
