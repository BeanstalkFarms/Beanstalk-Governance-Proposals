## Proposal

Hire CanadianBennett as an Operations Associate / Platform Wrangler

## Resume

CanadianBennett is a university student majoring in commercial aviation and minoring in business administration.  CanadianBennett has a strong understanding of cryptocurrency protocols and broad-based cryptocurrency community knowledge.  Outside of his studies, CanadianBennett has also taken on leadership roles with various organizations including USA Special Olympics where he coached low-functioning athletes.  In these roles, he successfully planned and executed numerous different campaigns and events.   CanadianBennett has part-time availability and would bring a “can-do” / “whatever is needed” attitude to Beanstalk.

## Role Definition

As Operations Associate / Platform Wrangler, CanadianBennett will focus on assisting Farmer Dan with the Q1 L3 Bounties and they will be the point of contact with various cryptocurrency websites that need to be updated (Coingecko, Coinmarketcap, etc.). 

This proposed role will engage in persistent communication with cryptocurrency websites such as [www.coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com/), [www.coingecko.com](http://www.coingecko.com/) and [uniswap.org](http://uniswap.org) about various Beanstalk details that need to be updated.  These websites are challenging to engage with and require repeated, persistent follow-ups to achieve results. CanadianBennett is up to the task. 

L3 bounties are a key aspect of Beanstalk's growth and community involvement.  With the rapid growth of Beanstalk, it will be important to accelerate the frequency and impact of L3 bounties throughout the year. Success with these L3 bounties should lead to a better sense of community and improve the overall marketing for Beanstalk.

## Payment

3,250 beans for Q1. 500 beans paid bimonthly. 

## Commitment

Part-time (minimum of 5 hours/week), through the end of March, 2022.
