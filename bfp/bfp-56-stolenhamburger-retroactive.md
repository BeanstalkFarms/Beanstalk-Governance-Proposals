**A Note on stolenhamburger’s Preferred Compensation:**

Stolenhamburger believes it is important to under-promise and over-deliver, which is why he asks for retroactive compensation rather than forward looking compensation. They understand the risk that this may pose, but they’d rather not get paid than possibly overpromising in any way. They are aligned with the long term growth of the protocol and wish the beans to be sown.
