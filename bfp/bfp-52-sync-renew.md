## Proposal

Renew Sync as a Growth Contributor PT (formerly Sync-you-Bate)

## Resume

Sync has been an active member of Beanstalk since discovering the project in 2021. Since then, he has written about multiple growth related ideas, and facilitated introductions for Beanstalk to several DeFi projects. He regularly engages the community and answers questions when available.

This renewal expands upon his initial Q1 commitment, and recognizes the additional time he has dedicated in Q1 and will commit moving forward to help Beanstalk Farms with potential integration efforts. Outside of Beanstalk, Sync has an extensive background in project/program management, and enjoys working on internal and external stakeholder related initiatives.

## Role Definition

This expanded Growth Contributor role reports to the head of Business Development and includes:

- Working with Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout to align proposed collaborations/integrations;
- Participating in stakeholder engagement discussions to raise awareness of Beanstalk;
- Addressing general inquiries to uphold communications continuity in Discord; and
- Clarifying and prioritizing the scope of integrations with the Beanstalk development team.

## Payment

6250 Beans per month, paid bi-monthly, beginning in Q2 2022. One-time payment of 5750 Beans for 100 additional hours worked in Q1, to be paid with first Q2 payment.

## Commitment

Part time (>25 hours per week) through Q2 2022. At-will. To be renewed upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q3 budget.
