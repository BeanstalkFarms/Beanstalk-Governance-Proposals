## Proposer

Max Sow

## Proposal

Hire Farmer Joe's Bean Emporium (Liamm) as a part time Growth Contributor in the Business Development Department of Beanstalk Farms reporting to Max Sow.

## Resume

Farmer Joe has been an active member of the community and an early sower during the first debt cycle of Beanstalk making his first sow at $0.27. Since then he has subsequently had lots of fun, introducing early community members such as Hugh and Beanintern into the DAO as well as designing future concepts for Beanstalk such as the Metabean play to earn game.

Before focusing on DeFi, Farmer Joe worked in partnerships development and strategic sales in FAANG after founding a consulting company specializing in commodity analysis for a number of years. (Wine grapes, not beans!)

Farmer Joe is excited to harmonize his interest in understanding new and innovative DeFi projects (and the teams behind them) with his existing skill set in partnership development.

## Role Definition

This Growth Contributor role will include working with the Business Development team to:

- Develop new partnerships/integrations with other DeFi Protocols (target 3 meaningful integrations/partnerships during Q1);
- Research and surface new target opportunities and define partnerships/integrations proposals; and
- Draft and coordinate partnership/ integration proposals.

## Payment

3000 Beans per month, paid twice per month, through Q1 2022. Starting on Feb 1st, 2022.

Retroactive payment of 1000 Beans for work performed over Dec and Jan.

## Commitment

Part time (minimum 15 hours per week) for Q1 2022. To be re-evaluated for renewal, adjustment or expansion upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q2 budget.
