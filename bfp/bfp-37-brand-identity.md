## Proposal

Obtain DAO consensus on new creative direction pitch by Beanstalk Farms.

## Summary

Beanstalk Farms is excited to proceed with a revamped brand identity that aligns more closely to Beanstalk’s core values, personality and needs. The Brand Identity v2 will be finalized by the design department in Q1 2022 and will be released in early Q2 2022. This Snapshot is to affirm or reject this new Brand Identity v2 at a high level. 

## Details

Beanstalk went through a brand strategy campaign from mid December to the end of January. The purpose of this campaign was to understand all high level aspects of Beanstalk’s current brand.

The campaign included:

- Live branding workshops with the DAO and multiple extended calls with Publius;
- Analysis and synthesis of brand story (vision, purpose, mission).
- Target audience research & analysis;
- Market research & analysis;
- Definition of user persona and common user journeys; and
- Definition of overarching goals.

The Design department at Beanstalk Farms took the results from the brand strategy campaign to develop foundational identity pieces that could be applied to all areas of Beanstalk’s brand.

These revamped pieces included:

- Creative Inspiration & Stylescapes;
- Logotype and Logomark;
- Color Palette and Guidelines;
- Typography and Guidelines;
- Layout and Spacing Guidelines; and
- Asset Demo Samples.

Though much of Beanstalk’s future brand experience is still to be developed, this brand identity direction can be used as a foundation.

Because Beanstalk Farms is an organization funded and governed by the Beanstalk DAO, we would like to obtain explicit support on the new creative direction before proceeding in the form of a Snapshot. Voting yes on this proposal means giving Beanstalk Farms permission to proceed with Beanstalk’s new brand identity and experience rebrand based on the brand identity direction pitch given at the DAO meeting on 2-17-2022. Notes and a recording of that meeting can be found here:
