## Proposal

Hire Silo Chad as Frontend Lead for Q1 2022. 

## Resume

Silo Chad is a full-stack software engineer and UI/UX designer. He most recently served in a mixture of engineering, operations, and community roles for a venture fund. Previously, he ran an independent consultancy performing design and engineering work for startups and VC firms.
Throughout December, he contributed to Beanstalk's frontend code and pushed a first series of UI tweaks intended to simplify the website's structure.

## Role Definition

As the capabilities of Beanstalk expand throughout Q1, it's crucial for the engineering team to establish a rapid pace of development, maintain a high bar for code quality, and pay close attention to UI/UX. While the protocol is built with simple primitives at its core, designing and building an interface to allow users to clearly interact with Beanstalk is a non-trivial engineering and design challenge. Clean design, well-written code and swift execution will only increase in importance with the launch of the Pod Marketplace, integration into other protocols like Curve, open-sourcing of the frontend repository, and more.

Silo Chad will spearhead these efforts by serving as the frontend team lead. His work will include:

- Organizing the frontend team's operations, setting roadmap, and maintaining a rapid pace of development.
- Re-architecting and cleaning up the frontend codebase in preparation for open-sourcing in late Q1.
- Building components for the release of Pod Marketplace, Curve pool, and others.
- Finding and onboarding new engineers to the team.
- Reviewing PRs for quality and ensuring clear UI/UX in all components shipped.
- Serving as a bridge between the engineering & design team to ensure the design teams' vision is properly executed.

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hours/week) for Q1 2022. 

## Payment

15,000 Beans/month
