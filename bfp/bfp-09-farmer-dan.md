## Proposal

Hire Farmer Dan as Operations Associate (Merch Lead, Event Coordinator) for Q1 2022

## Resume

Farmer Dan is a salesman by trade, and currently works at a startup in the Capital Loan Markets space and has been a part of Beanstalk since the end of September. Over the past month, he has become more involved in the protocol, assisting Dumpling, and generally interacting with the community via Twitter and Discord. Farmer Dan has decided to dedicate 20 hours a week to furthering The Beanstalk Protocol and its mission.

## Role Definition

The Operations Associate role supports the operations department by leading projects that support Beanstalk’s continued growth and adoption. Current projects that Farmer Dan is leading are Layer 3 Bounties, Beanstalk Merch Project, and The Beans of Poker Tournament.

- **Layer 3 Bounties:** The first round of bounties (headed by Bean Merchant) were a success, so Farmer Dan has been planning a second, expanded round of bounties. The first round had a 8 bounties and a budget of 5,000 beans, and the second round will be roughly twice the size and scope. The Layer 3 project is documented on Notion.
- **Beanstalk Merch Project:** Farmer Dan is currently heading up the merch project for the protocol. Having some industry connections, he has been able to find a reputable supplier that is cost effective and willing to form a long-term relationship. The second round of merch is estimated to arrive by the 3rd week in January and Farmer Dan will coordinate the delivery at that time. Farmer Dan will facilitate future merch projects as well. The ultimate vision is to have a merch store where a myriad of items can be purchased using beans, along with items to be given as awards, rewards, airdrops, etc. The merch project is listed on Notion for transparency and clarity.
- **The Beans of Poker Tournament:** Dumpling and Farmer Dan have recently drafted a proposal for a new project called “The Beans of Poker Tournament”. While the project is pre-proposal, they have received early support with hopes to take this to the next level soon. The project will have many facets to it, and Farmer Dan will be heading the project with the support of Dumpling. The current timeline for this project is February. Notion page to come soon.
- **Regarding future projects:** Farmer Dan will continue to be of assistancewhere needed. After the Layer3 bounties are published and the merch orders are underway, The “Beans of Poker” Tournament will be his main focus until the project is completed. After completion, he will continue to assist where necessary to help beanstalk grow.

## Payment

4766 beans per month starting on January 1st, 2022, paid bi-monthly.As Farmer Dan began work in December, a retroactive payment for work done before Q1 of 1250 beans will be included with his first payment.
