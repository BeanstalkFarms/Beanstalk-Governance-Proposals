## Proposal

Pay Hugh retroactively as Notion and Discord Architect for Beanstalk.

## Resume

Hugh is a Product Manager, startup founder and former management consultant with extensive experience working with decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs). He currently leads Operations at KlimaDAO, and was an early contributor at OlympusDAO during its growth phase. Leveraging both his experience in advising traditional organisations, as well as building startups, products and DAOs, Hugh has developed a set of best practices for how remote teams and DAOs can coordinate work, manage resources effectively, and get the most important things done.

    - Implemented cross-populating department-level pages (with appropriate database filtering) and supported in discussions on structure and scope of departments
    - Integrated Notion Forms for contributor applications and recruitment function, and documented process from application through to onboarding
    - Developed a customer relationship manager (CRM) in Notion for Beanstalk’s Business Development team to manage their opportunities, contacts and associated organisations

    - Provided appropriate access permissions for contributors as required
    - Ported over past data from old Notion instance
- Discord setup, informed by industry best practices and custom tailored for Beanstalk
    - Defined roles and permissions for contributors by department

    - Configured Discord Bot to enable contributor application process
    - Combined and eliminated redundant channels for a cleaner user experience
    - Custom-tailored Discord to the specific needs of Beanstalk
- Training
    - Ran synchronous training calls for the community to share how to use Notion and Discord
    - Recorded a series of training videos for onboarding new users and contributors
    - Created a written guide on how to use the Beanstalks Farms Notion instance
    - Developed “start here” page on Notion, providing a structured guide for new contributors
    - Provided CRM training for Business Development Lead
    - Ran personalized training/troubleshooting with department heads
- Continuous ad hoc support as required

## Payment

Pay Hugh a one time retroactive payment of 50,000 beans for his work on the Notion and Discord sprint. Upon completion of the initial setup, Hugh will continue to work and support our use of the Notion and Discord in the coming months, dependent on a separate Snapshot proposal.

## Commitment

Retroactive. Work almost completed. One-time payment of 50,000 Beans.
