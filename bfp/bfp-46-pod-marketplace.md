## Proposal

Increase Farmers Market payment by 20,000 Beans to 30,000 Beans. 

## Reasoning

The Farmers Market is a crucial feature and the first major addition to the Beanstalk EIP-2535 Diamond implementation. The work required a number of novel decisions, original architecture, and simultaneous collaborative work from independent designers, frontend, and backend engineers. 

The Farmers Market was initially proposed with a 10,000 Bean bounty. Now that development work has concluded, the team believes that the effort was greatly underestimated and is requesting an increase in the payment to a total of 30,000 Beans.

The Farmers Market was a resounding success and can be found at: [https://app.bean.money/market](https://app.bean.money/market)

## Payment

20,000 Beans, paid upon approval of this snapshot.
