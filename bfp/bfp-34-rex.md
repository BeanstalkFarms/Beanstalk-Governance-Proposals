## Proposal

Hire Rex as Beanstalk Community Manager within the Community Department.

## Resume

Rex19611 has nearly ten years of leadership experience, including five at a Fortune 500 energy company. He has led teams of frontline hourly employees, specialized individual contributors, and professional engineers. Prior to his energy experience, he was the founding director of a satellite campus of a small local college, managing staff and faculty while serving the needs of students.

Rex holds an undergraduate degree in History and Political Science, an MBA from a respected UK university, and is in the dissertation stage of a PhD in Business Psychology (specializing in Behavioral Economics) from a respected US university.

Rex became involved with Beanstalk in November of 2021 and has since sown an almost irresponsible number of Pods into the Field. He has also become a full-throated advocate of the protocol both in the Discord server and on Twitter (under the name Ryan Stalker), spreading awareness and building relationships with internal stakeholders and the public at large.

* Develop specific strategies to identify, contact, and build relationships with likeminded communities, organizations, and projects (e.g., other DAOs/Discords).
* Develop the protocol’s presence on Reddit and Instagram. 
* Whenever possible, represent Beanstalk at in-person events. 
* Guide and support the Community Team as it takes on specific projects, including but not limited to:
  * The Beanstalk Poker Tournament
