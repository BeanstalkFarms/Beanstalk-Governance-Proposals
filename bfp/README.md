# Beanstalk Farms Proposal (BFP)

Beanstalk Farms Proposals, or BFPs, were proposals related to budgeting and processes for [Beanstalk Farms](https://docs.bean.money/governance/beanstalk-farms). In particular, pre-exploit they were used for hiring decisions and post-exploit they were used for the Beanstalk DAO to signal support for various iterations of the [Barn Raise](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#barn-raise) and [Replant](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#replant).

There were 81 BFPs. BFPs have been deprecated.
