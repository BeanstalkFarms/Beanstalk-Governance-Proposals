## Proposer

Beanstalk Farms

This vote will be decided by a simple majority with no quorum.

## Summary

Beanstalk Farms proposes using the remaining 300,000 USDC as a discretionary operating budget to support Beanstalk on The Path Forward (https://bean.money/blog/path-forward).

## Reasoning

As part of the April 17 governance attack, the Beanstalk Flashloan Exploiter sent 250,000 USDC to a Ukraine relief fund wallet owned by Kuna Exchange (https://twitter.com/ChobanianMike/status/1516188257440219145). Kuna returned the funds to Beanstalk Farms on April 24 (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xda56cdb1c9acc01e0ba87fb592384a030b0526baa624256fee79a2df334c7e00).

After paying Halborn to perform an audit, 50,000 USDC is leftover from the funds initially reserved for the Omniscia retainer. Thus, Beanstalk Farms currently holds 300,000 USDC.

Due to the governance attack and subsequently stolen liquidity, the Beans allocated to Beanstalk Farms’ Q2 Budget are worthless. As a result, Beanstalk currently lacks the necessary funds to retain high-quality service providers who can help ensure a safe, secure and defensible Unpause post-Barn Raise.

Allocation of funds will include a number of organizational initiatives in the following areas, among others:
• Security infrastructure
• DAO operational expenses
• Strategic contributors

## Proposed Budget

All 300,000 USDC remaining.
