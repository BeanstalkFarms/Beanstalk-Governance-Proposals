He has already hosted the first Beans on the Table Poker Tournament, the initial Bean Basics session, co-hosted several Twitter Spaces, drafted the Zero to Beanstalk curriculum, and has plans for several other Community-building events/initiatives. Additionally, he has worked with Marketing, Copy, Design, and Community to roll-out the first educational video.
