## Proposal

Hire JWW for Product Manager role

## Resume

JWW has been an active part of Beanstalk since September 2021 (present in all AMAs, classes, DAO meetings, Twitter Spaces since joining over 4 months ago). Efforts have included ongoing community engagement in the Discord, directional support around design/creative and onboarding, drafting Medium posts, and most notably rolled out the Winter BeaNFT Collection and the formation of the BeanNFT DAO strategy in partnership with Beanstalk design/creative and developer support. To date, the project has come in under budget while still delivering on time. Outside of Beanstalk, JWW has +9 years of experience managing teams of data scientists, engineers, marketers, and designers while working at and consulting for several Fortune 500 companies before creating their own start-up. JWW has extensive experience with marketing, specifically on creating marketing strategies, establishing KPIs and targets, growing marketing teams, vetting and managing marketing support partners and vendors/agencies, running paid media campaigns, building strong brand reputation via earned media and working with editors, overseeing PR teams, and collecting customer feedback via various data sources. Most importantly, JWW believes in the vision and future of Beanstalk and is excited to bring his breadth of experience to the DAO.
