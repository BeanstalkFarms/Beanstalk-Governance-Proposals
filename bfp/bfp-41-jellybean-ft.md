## Proposal

Promote Jellybean as full-time UX/UI design lead within the Design department.

## Resume

Jellybean is a lead product designer interested in facilitating UX strategy at Beanstalk to help the team build better experiences. Jellybean is experienced in user research and design strategy and has spent the past 7+ years leading various fintech companies for these roles. Jellybean regularly facilitates cross-functional design sprints, teaches user research courses for companies, and gives design talks in the community.

Jellybean has been functioning as the part-time UX/UI design lead for the past 2 weeks at Beanstalk. During this limited time, they have made significant improvements to the UX/UI development process and are currently leading out the website overhaul. In order to hit deadlines and expedite the design process, they are willing to transition full-time to Beanstalk Farms from their current full-time job.

## Role Definition

This full-time UX/UI design lead position will be the main contributor of UX/UI design related work within the Design Department. This role reports to the head of the Design Department and itâ€™s responsibilities include:

- Proactive and operational user research;
- Presenting research findings to stakeholders and delivering product opportunity or design recommendations;
- Information architecture;
- UX strategy;
- Creating visual artifacts to communicate intent, such as wireframes, wireflows, mockups, prototypes; and
- UI design implementation with the support of branding, styling guidelines and art direction.

## Payment

16.5k Beans per month, paid bi-monthly, through Q2 2022, as of March 1st, 2022.

## Commitment

Full Time, Minimum 40 hours a week through Q2 2022. At-will.

Beanstalk Farms has a dire need for high quality production to drive the next major growth cycle as it approaches Q2. In order to match the high standard of the protocol, Beanstalk Farms is motivated to attract the best talent with industry premium wages. Beanstalk Farms is more inclined to hire a few key extremely proficient contributors at a premium price than 7 or 8 contributors at a standard price. Beanstalk Farms believes this hiring philosophy will lead to lean development teams that are highly efficient, fast-paced and much more productive than a standard larger team. This type of wage distribution should allow Beanstalk Farms to maintain a lean budget while properly compensating its premium contributors for their work. Beanstalk Farms will make efforts to stay lean until the next major growth cycle.
