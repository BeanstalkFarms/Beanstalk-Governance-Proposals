## Proposer

Dumpling

## Proposal

Hire Anon123 as a Part-time Solidity Developer in the Engineering Department.

## Resume

Anon123 is a full-stack software engineer and will be joining the backend team within the Engineering Department at Beanstalk. His last job was as a full-stack web3 developer at a layer 2 order book exchange.

## Role Definition

Anon123 will work closely with Beasley and others on back end solidity development. As the back end team continues to expand the capabilities of Beanstalk, having independent developers to contribute to the Solidity is key to the continued decentralization of protocol development. 

## Payment

6760 Beans per month, paid twice per month, as of February 28th, 2022, though the end of Q1 2022.

## Commitment

Part-time (21+ hours/week)
