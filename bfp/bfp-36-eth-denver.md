## Proposal

Fund an ETH Denver Beanstalk Happy Hour. 

## Reasoning

ETHDenver is the largest crypto hackathon in North America and many of the Bean Farmers are there for it. We’d like to throw a small get-together for the current Bean Farmers, and the Bean Farmers who are being pilled in real-time.

## Budget

Beanstalk Farms is proposing a budget of 2,000 Beans for an ETHDenver event that provides food and beverages to attendees. The event will be night of Friday the 18th at 5:30pm MT. We expect around 35 attendees. This is the first IRL Bean meetup of its kind and we’re excited to also have Bean-curious people in attendance.

## Payment

Max Sow has generously offered to pay for the event out-of-pocket and be later reimbursed by Beanstalk Farms. Upon snapshot approval funds will be distributed to him.
