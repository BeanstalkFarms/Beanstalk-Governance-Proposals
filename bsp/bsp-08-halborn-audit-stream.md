## Proposer

Bean Sprout

## Summary

* Pay Halborn 20,000 USDC worth of Beans to fund a fourth audit stream for one month as an extension of the Halborn Retainer Agreement. 
* This new audit stream is and intended to be used to expedite the audit and release of new code which implements:
    * the Generalized Pipeline; and
    * a contract developed by a 3rd party that will integrate Roots natively at launch.

## Incentive Alignment

Halborn has agreed to be compensated in Beans for the fourth audit stream and verbally expressed intent to retain long-term Bean exposure. This is a healthy setup that creates mutual interest in the success of Beanstalk.

## Effective 

The audit stream is slated to begin on 10/10/2022. Upon passage of this BSP, 20,000 USDC worth of Beans will be sent to Halborn, or used to reimburse the payer of the Beans. The Bean price at the time of payment will be used to determine the number of Beans sent to Halborn.
