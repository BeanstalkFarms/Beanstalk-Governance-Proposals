## Proposer

Bean Sprout

## Summary

Pay Halborn 40,000 Beans to cover the Bean portion of the Halborn Retainer from Bean Sproutâ€™s Q3 2022 budget. The total cost is 200,000 USDC and 40,000 Beans. Root Labs has agreed to cover the USDC portion of the Halborn payment.

The ongoing Halborn Retainer Agreement is slated to begin on 8/22/22. The retainer will cover three simultaneous audit streams for the first two months, and two simultaneous audit streams for the subsequent four months, for a total of 6 months.

## Goals

* Reaudit Beanstalk
* Audit the Beanstalk UI
* Facilitate rapid, deployment of audited upgrades to Beanstalk and Beanstalk-related projects
* Establish a long-term, mutually-aligned relationship with a leading smart-contract auditing firm

## Incentive Alignment

Halborn has agreed to be partially compensated in Beans and verbally expressed intent to maintain long-term bean exposure. This is a healthy setup that creates mutual interest in the success of Beanstalk.

## Effective

The audits are scheduled to begin on Monday August 22, 2022. Upon passage of this BSP, the 40,000 Beans will be sent to Halborn, or used to reimburse the payer of the Beans.
