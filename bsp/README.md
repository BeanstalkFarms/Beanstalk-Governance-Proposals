# Bean Sprout Proposal (BSP)

Bean Sprout Proposals, or BSPs, are proposals to spend the [Bean Sprout](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/bean-sprout) budget.

You can read more about BSPs [here](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/bean-sprout#spending).

There were 10 BSPs. BFPs have been deprecated until Bean Sprout is funded again by the Beanstalk DAO.
