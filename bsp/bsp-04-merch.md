## Usage and rationale

So far Beanstalk merch has been utilized in: 

- Building Twitter presence - spreading documents such as the Roadmap and generating following for Beanstalk accounts
- Community building - Designs created and chosen by community members
- AMA attendance awards

Future uses:

- Poker tournament prize pool
- Awards for bounties and Twitter contests
- Event Marketing
- Influencer Marketing (ipoandchill)
- Ultimately a merchandise shop connected to the website

We believe that implementing Beanstalk merch has helped on several unique fronts already. It has incentivized the sharing of Beanstalk information across social media, brought in new community members, and brought our existing community closer together. Beanstalk merch has transcended the barriers of the internet and brought Beanstalk into the real world. It’s only a matter of time before you see a Farmer on the street wearing a Beanstalk t-shirt and know you’re in good company. 

## Payment

5,600 beans from the Q1 2022 BeanSprout budget to pay for merch invoices and shipping costs.
