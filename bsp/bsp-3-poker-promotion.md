## Proposal

Fund several promotions for the “Beans on the Table” Poker Tournament to increase participation. 

## Reasoning

Bean Sprout is hosting a tournament on March 5th to demonstrate Bean’s utility and build relationships with other prominent DAOs in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. In order to increase awareness and attendance of the tournament, we are planning a variety of promotional efforts.  

## Budget

Beanstalk Farms is proposing a budget of 3,000 beans, spent in the following ways:

1,000 Beans: Cameos including Phil Hellmuth and Norman Chad to “call out” members of the defi community to encourage participation. 

1,500 Beans: Networking within NFT communities to give them free buy-ins in exchange for NFTs that will be part of the prize pool. 

500 Beans: “Wanted” signs shared on twitter via giveaways. 

Note: These promotional efforts will result in only ~1,000 Bean sell pressure to pay for the cameos, as the other beans will be used for buy-ins. 

## Payment

Dumpling has offered to pay for the event out-of-pocket and be later reimbursed by Beanstalk Farms. Upon snapshot approval funds will be distributed to him.
