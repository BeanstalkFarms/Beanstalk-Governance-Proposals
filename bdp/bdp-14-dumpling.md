## Proposer

Publius

## Proposal

7500 Beans to hire Dumpling as a full time Operations Manager through the end of the year.

## Resume

Dumpling has been an active, early member of Beanstalk who has been taking increasing roles and responsibilities within the DAO. He has been enthusiastically engaging the community and pulling in new members to begin working for the DAO. His role of Operations Manager will allow Publius to step back from many of the tasks they have been handling until now and this will allow them more time for high-level development of Beanstalk. Operations will handle:

- Recruiting and onboarding new talent to Beanstalk
- Designing an onboarding process for new members
- Engaging with the community on a day-to-day basis
- Working with Business Development as needed
- Working with Content Creators to help create materials on Beanstalk
- Working with Marketing to help spread the word about Beanstalk
- Attending weekly DAO meetings, A&T University meetings, Branding and other meetings
- Leading other projects such as special community events planning
- Any other tasks as needed that are not assigned to other departments/roles

## Payment 

7500 Beans allocated through the end of 2021. Dumpling started working December 1st. Payment will be issued twice a month in sowed beans.

## Commitment

Full time (40 hours per week) through the end of the year. To be renewed upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q1 Budget.
