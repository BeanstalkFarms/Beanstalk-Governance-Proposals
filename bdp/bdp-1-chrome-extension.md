## Proposal

Community Member Beanjoyer has created a chrome extension for the $BEAN price. To properly reward them for their contribution, we propose sending Beanjoyer a one time payment of 300 Beans for his work from the development budget.

This would be a one time payment, made upon passage of the proposal. Publius will make the payment from the dev budget.
