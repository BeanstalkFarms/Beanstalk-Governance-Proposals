## Proposer

Publius

## Summary

One of the most highly requested additions to Beanstalk is a decentralized way to trade Pods. There has been a strong amount of interest from the community in developing the first version of a Pod Marketplace. In order to incentivize high quality, timely development and collaboration, we want to allocate 10,000 Beans to be distributed to contributors to the Pod Marketplace v1 in line with their contribution.

## Payment

10,000 Beans, paid upon deployment. Payments will be distributed according to the discretion of Beanjoyer, who is the lead community member on the project and has already started development.

## Completed v1 Specs

Offer to Buy:

- max place in pod line
- bid price
- bid amount of Pods

Offer to Sell:

- plot (specify range)
- offer price
- place in pod line the offer expires

Necessary Features:

- Gas efficient
- Completely decentralized exchange
- Immediate clearance if filling bid or ask
- Immediate clearance in decentralized fashion if Pod Line movement causes bid and ask to overlap
- Front end independant website page
- Front end integration with bean.money

Other Potential Features:

- bids and asks over a range can have a linear change in price
- Either a BIP to Beanstalk or just a separate contractâ€¦TBD

## Timing

If approved, the payment will be distributed by Publius in lump sums upon successful deployment of the Pod Marketplace v1.

## Voting

Vote yes to approve the budget allocation. Vote no to disapprove of the budget allocation.

## Process

Reach out to Beanjoyer directly via Discord to contribute to the development of the v1 Pod marketplace.
