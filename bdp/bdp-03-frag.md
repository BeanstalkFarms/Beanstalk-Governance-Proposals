## Proposer

Publius

## Summary

FRAG is a member of the Beanstalk community who has discussed work to developing Beanstalk with Publius. FRAG wishes to remain anonymous. Publius has interviewed FRAG and feels they are highly qualified to assist in the development of Beanstalk. FRAG will start by working on developing the analytics suite for the bean.money website and help prepare the code for the website to be open-sourced. Over time, FRAGâ€™s responsibilities will expand beyond just the website. 

## Proposal

Allocate 17500 Beans from the development budget to hire FRAG full-time to develop the Beanstalk website analytics suite through the end of the year.

## Payment

10000 Beans per month, payable twice a month.

## Commitment

Full time through the end of 2021. To be renewed if there is mutual interest at the time.

FRAG will develop the analytics suite for the bean.money website with the intention to expand the scope of their responsibilities over time.

A complex analytics suite that is easy to use will serve an important function in creating more efficient and widespread access to data on Beanstalk. Improved data will create a more efficient market around Beanstalk.

Open-sourcing the code will give visibility and the ability for quality community-driven contributions.
