## Proposer

Publius

## Proposal

13,750 Beans to hire LeonardoFibonacci as a full time Solidity developer through the end of the year.

## Resume

LeonardoFibonacci is an intelligent and curious full stack developer with a strong interest in Beanstalk. LeonardoFibonacci has previously worked in Solidity and will be able to work on the back end.

## Payment

12500 Beans per month, allocated through the end of 2021. LeonardoFibonacci started this Monday, so the additional 1,250 Beans are to compensate him for the first 3 days of week, which were in November. He had originally agreed to wait for the Q1 Budget to be paid, but it seems like there will be more Dev Budget funds for the remainder of Q4 than we had previously anticipated. Accordingly, we wanted to formally hire LeonardoFibonacci through a proposal ASAP. Payment will be issued twice a month.

## Commitment

Full time (40 hours per week) through the end of the year. To be renewed upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q1 Budget.

LeonardoFibonacci's primary responsibilities will be to assist in back end and middleware development of Beanstalk. We hope to have him submit at least 1 BIP.
