## The Problem

The release of the BeaNFT Genesis Collection was a big success. They encouraged new people to sow and brought some fun onto the farm. Over time, we know that they will be prized as badges that reflect support for Beanstalk from the very beginning.

But there is a lot more we can do with BeaNFTs. The nature of NFTs allows us to manipulate art and collectibles in ways that were never possible before.

It is understood that the purpose of Beanstalk is not to generate NFTs or be a DAO concerned with NFTs. But the setting aside of appropriate funds for the BeaNFTs and their continued creation will help market beans to a wider audience and possibly create even more value for those involved in the ecosystem.

## The Solution

This BDP will set aside 30,000 Beans to continue the BeaNFT project for 3 months from passage.

## Deliverables

The following items will be completed with funding from this BDP over the next 3 months:

- The creation, development and deployment of a winter themed BeaNFTs collection that will a) launch before the December holidays, b) incentivize increased liquidity by rewarding LP contributions to Beanstalk, and c) be connected to the BeaNFT Genesis Collection. The funds will pay for an artist and labor for creating and coordinating the winter BeaNFTs.
- A second BeaNFT surprise that will drive utility and value to the BeaNFTs in general, and the BeaNFT Genesis Collection specifically. Using game theory, we can drive up the value and rarity of all BeaNFTs and HAVE FUN.

An open question remains whether the BeaNFTs will be added as a facet to the Beanstalk contract, or will remain a separate contract. It seems the current BeaNFT contract is non-upgradable, so it may be a good opportunity to rejigger the architecture for the long haul now. We will discuss with the community and Publius the best way to proceed.
