## Proposer

Publius

## Summary

Allocate 4000 Beans to upgrade the Subgraph, cover web hosting costs, and pay for gas fees to continue issuing payments for Beanstalk Farms.

## Problem

Upgrading the Subgraph costs ~$500 every time, and Beanstalk Farms is constantly adding more features to the subgraph. The only delay in releasing new features on the website and bots is the funding to pay for deployment of new subgraphs.

As usage of bean.money and the decentralized development team working of it grows, the infrastructure supporting it must grow as well. Good infrastructure is not free.

Issuing payments in Beans and Pods is costly. Beanstalk Farms issues payments to almost a dozen independent contributors, some of whom receive both Beans and Pods. This is costly to do.

## Solution

Allocate 4000 Beans to cover these and similar costs through the remainder of the year. This should help expedite upgrades to the subgraph and ensure timely payment to contributors.
