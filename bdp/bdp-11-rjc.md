## Proposer

Publius

## Proposal

8333 Beans to hire rjc as a full time frontend developer through the end of the year.

## Resume

rjc is an intelligent and curious full stack developer with a strong interest in Beanstalk. rjc has extensive experience in crypto, and will add ecosystem knowledge and experience to the front end dev team.

## Payment

62.5 Beans per hour, allocated through the end of 2021. rjc started this Monday and had originally agreed to wait for the Q1 Budget to be paid, but it seems like there will be more Dev Budget funds for the remainder of Q4 than we had previously anticipated. Accordingly, we wanted to formally hire rjc through a proposal ASAP. Payment will be issued twice a month.

## Commitment

Part time (an average of 33 hours, 20 mins per week) through the end of the year. To be renewed upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q1 Budget.

rjc primary responsibilities will be to assist in front end development of Beanstalk. We hope to have them cover a variety of needs on the front end.
