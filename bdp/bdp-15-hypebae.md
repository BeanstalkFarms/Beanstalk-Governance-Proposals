## Proposal

992 Beans to hire Hypebae as a PT Communications Associate through the end of the year.

## Resume

Hypebae is a diplomat, currently serving as a foreign affairs officer in the State Department in the Office of Counterterrorism and Financial Designations. She understands the global views of those concerned by crypto and defi. Prior to this position, she previously represented the United States at the United Nations and advocated for U.S. counterterrorism policies and built partnerships with other countries for counterterrorism programming. She worked for both Democrat and Republican Administrations. In her role at the UN, she wrote memos to prepare Cabinet-Level officials for their meetings, as well as represented the United States counterterrorism policies in negotiations, written and media documents and at conferences. This experience can translate well to a communications role for Beanstalk Protocol. This Communications role will include:

- Creating professional communications documents such as press releases, mission statements, newsletters and other such writing as needed
- Connecting with financial PR managers (Hypebae has connections here) to raise awareness of Beanstalk
- Coordinating community events
- Representing Beanstalk at conferences when able
- Co-hosting twitter spaces to raise awareness of Beanstalk
- Handling the Beanstalk Twitter feed

## Payment

992 Beans allocated through the end of 2021

## Commitment

Part-time (5 hours per week) to begin, through the end of the year. To be renewed and potentially expanded upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q1 Budget
