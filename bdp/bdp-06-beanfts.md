## Summary

Beanstalkâ€™s mission is to be the leading decentralized stablecoin. To accomplish this, Beanstalk needs to simultaneously recruit new, ideally high-quality capital into the protocol while preserving the existing capital and userbase. The success of the first NFT drops was a good jumping of point to introduce both.

Beanstalk launched its BeaNFTs Genesis Collection during seasons 1200-1800 for 25 days to incentivize lenders to sow beans with a chance to win a unique NFT every season. The result has been a deepening and broadening of the community as 2,067 non-utility based v1 BeaNFTs varietals were created and collected by the top 10 sowers each season.

## Problem

While the initial Genesis Collection did accomplish the goal of driving new users into the protocol and encouraging existing members to re-invest, there is ongoing work that can be done to continue building Beanstalk brand awareness while simultaneously further enmeshing existing users and providing value to their NFTs.

BeaNFTs are a fantastic tool to promote Beanstalk and ensure growth and retention at the same time, so in order for BeaNFTs to return the most value possible for both existing NFT holders, future community members, and Beanstalk as a whole, a clear roadmap paired with intermittent consensus needs to be created and executed on over the next 10 weeks. To continue growing the protocol, we cannot wait another month to consider next steps with NFTs or two months before the next roll out begins. We need swift, clear execution to capitalize on our momentum.

## Solution-based, High-level Deliverables

1. This BDP will set aside up to 25,000 Beans to do the following over the next 10 weeks.
2. Create BeaNFT roadmap for Dec 2021-Februrary 2022 while taking into consideration both existing design assets so as to not overspend and account for upcoming BIP and BDP changes (ex: deployment of potential LP lending into Field or LP encouraged into the silo, design changes on the website, etc.)
3. Conduct weekly BeaNFT updates via Discord chat in BeaNFT clubroom or barnyard

4. Propose and execute on marketing budget to list BeaNFT on rarity.tools

5. Outline best practices for NFT roll-outs and create BeaNFT best practices

6. Maintain ongoing list of community feedback for future considerations and spec out dev/design time cost for each

7. Partner with development teams to finesse existing infrastructure and improve on any infrastructure changes as needed

8. Partner with designer to create and ensure existing Beanstalk and BeaNFT brand identity is expanded upon (not lost) through loose desibrand guidelines

9. Submit any necessary BDPs for future dev/design work needs to execute on milestone enhancements (currently all within scope but could expand)

10. Partner with other community members to help socialize/implement upcoming NFT milestones (ex: partner with ipoandchill across social channels IG, TikTok, Twitter for socializing/creating hype and Dumpling when considering bean merch for burning NFTs)

11. Create simple tutorials/docs for newcomers to understand how each part of the BeaNFT ecosystem works and pin in Discord

12. Preserve existing BeaNFT design while specing v2 to prevent dilution of existing Genesis Collection v1 holders (ex: establish v1 preservation value techniques when designing v2 while utilizing remaining 4,000 varietals)

13. Ensure all code is in-house at Beanstalk farms for future iterations of NFTs

14. Work with dev to ensure future contracts are upgradable and share impact to existing NFT holders

## High-level Timeline (Preliminary)

Week 1: Create and socialize BeaNFT roadmap

Weeks 2-3: Develop and design Genesis Collection 2, prep social/marketing outreach

Week 3-6: Launch and maintain Genesis Collection 2 to run from seasons 3200-3800 (est.); draft bean design guidelines; begin dev work on next NFT milestones

Week 6-10: Finalize dev and design work for subsequent NFT milestones; roll out and socialize post-Genesis Collection 2 NFTs
