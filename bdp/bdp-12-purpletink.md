## Proposer 

Publius

## Proposal

8333 Beans to hire Purpletink as a full time Frontend developer through the end of the year.

## Resume

Purpletink is a curious and self-starting front end developer with an interest in Beanstalk. Purpletink has some experience with subgraphs, which will help as the website further integrates subgraph data.

## Payment

10000 Beans allocated through the end of 2021. Purpletink started this Monday and had originally agreed to wait for the Q1 Budget to be paid, but it seems like there will be more Dev Budget funds for the remainder of Q4 than we had previously anticipated. Accordingly, we wanted to formally hire Purpletink through a proposal ASAP. Payment will be issued twice a month.

## Commitment

Full time (40 hours per week) through the end of the year. To be renewed upon approval of the Beanstalk Farms Q1 Budget.

Purpletink primary responsibilities will be to assist in front end development of Beanstalk. We hope to have them cover a variety of needs on the front end.
