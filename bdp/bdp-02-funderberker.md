## Proposer

Publius

## Summary

funderberker is a member of the Beanstalk community who reached out to Publius to work on developing Beanstalk. funderberker wishes to remain anonymous. Publius has interviewed funderberker and feels they are highly qualified to assist in the development of Beanstalk. funderberker will lead the development of the telegram bot suite for Beanstalk.

## Proposal

Allocate 13440 Beans from the development budget to hire funderberker to develop the Beanstalk telegram bot suite through the end of the year.

## Payment 

80 Beans per hour, payable twice a month.

## Commitment

An average of 21 hours per week, through the end of 2021. The hours worked per week may be slightly more or less hours than average. To be renewed if there is mutual interest at the time.

funderberker will develop the following telegram bots, in no particular order:

- Peg crossing bot that sends a message each time the Bean price crosses $1.
- BEAN:ETH pool bot that sends a message upon each pool interaction (buys, sells, adds, removes).
- Sunrise bot that sends a message upon each sunrise with relevant stats for the current/previous Season.
- Beanstalk contract bot that sends a message upon each interaction with the Beanstalk contract (deposits, withdrawals, claims, sows, harvests).

funderberker will also develop a telegram bot architecture that will allow Telegram users to initialize a custom bot by sending a list of wallets and then return all relevant information for the given wallets upon each sunrise.

The Telegram bots will serve an important function in creating more efficient and widespread access to data on Beanstalk. Improved data will create a more efficient market around Beanstalk.
