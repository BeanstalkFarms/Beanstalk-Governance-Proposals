## Role

Beanstalk Stenographer is a new role. The stenographer will be critical to scaling the DAO through taking detailed, consistent minutes from meetings, A&T University classes, and other events. Until now, various members of the DAO have been requesting notes from meetings that they could not attend, and without having a dedicated person to take notes the response has been underwhelming. 0xaustin has the attention to detail and available schedule to take these minutes and to bring the organization of Beanstalk Farms to the next level.

## Proposer
