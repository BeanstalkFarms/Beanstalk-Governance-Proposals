## Proposer 

Publius

## Proposal

Many of the people being paid from both the dev and marketing budgets have asked to have some or all of the Beans allocated to them sown immediately to lock in their place in the Pod Line and be paid the appropriate amount of Pods when payments are due. Having BeanstalkFarms members with incentives that are properly aligned with the long-term growth of Beanstalk is ideal.

We propose an update to the budget contract that allows for budgeted Beans to be sown on behalf of the payee. The payee will then be paid in the form of a Plot instead of Beans.

## Procedure 

Anyone with an allocation from either budget currently not payable can request Publius sow all or a portion of their Beans. Publius will sow the requested amount of Beans and will make the payment in Pods. The number of Pods due is the number of Pods earned from sowing the Beans that were to be paid out.

## Upgrade

Upon passage of this proposal Publius will upgrade both budget contracts.
