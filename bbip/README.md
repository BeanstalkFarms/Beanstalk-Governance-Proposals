# Beanstalk Budget Improvement Proposal (BBIP)

BBIPs were upgrades made to the [Beanstalk Q4 2021 Budget Contract](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Budget). Since Q1 2022, both the Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout budgets have been custodied by [multisig wallets](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/protocol/contracts#multisigs).

There was only ever one BBIP. BBIPs have been deprecated.
