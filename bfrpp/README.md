# Beanstalk Farms Retroactive Payment Proposal (BFRPP)

Both [Beanstalk Farms](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk-farms) and [Bean Sprout](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/bean-sprout) custodied Unripe Beans upon the Replant of Beanstalk.

Each Beanstalk Farms contributor who felt they should be compensated retroactively for their contributions between the April 17, 2022 governance exploit and the Unpause on August 6, 2022 wrote a proposal that included their contributions and proposed Unripe Bean payment. 

There was only ever 1 BFRPP. BFRPPs have been deprecated.
