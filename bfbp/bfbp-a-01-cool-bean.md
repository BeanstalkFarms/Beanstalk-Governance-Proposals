## Summary

Hire Cool Bean full-time as a Senior Frontend Engineer.

## Background

Cool Bean is a software engineer who had worked at a large tech company and contributed to several web projects before contributing to Beanstalk.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

Cool Bean began contributing to [Beanstalk UI V1](https://pre-exploit-beanstalk-ui.netlify.app/) part-time in February 2022 and joined full-time in March. Contributions to Beanstalk UI V1 include:
* Led the development of the [Silo rebuild](https://pre-exploit-beanstalk-ui.netlify.app/silo);
* Refactored and standardized components in preparation for open-sourcing the UI codebase;
* Helped implement a new WalletConnect library; 
* Fixed various bugs and style tweaks; and
* Built support for Twitter and YouTube embed links on [bean.money](https://bean.money/).

Cool Bean continued to contribute (more than) full-time after the exploit. Contributions include:
* Contributed to the build of multiple versions of the Barn Raise UI while the Path Forward was going through multiple iterations.
* Contributed to the build of [Beanstalk UI V2](https://app.bean.money/) from scratchâ€”
    * Built page structure and components for most of the major pages;
    * Built complex form functionality and implemented contract calls for functions like Sow, Transfer and Harvest;
    * Designed and built reusable components to minimize code redundancy across the codebase;
    * Implemented a standardized styling system; and
    * Helped onboard a new contributor into the codebase.

## Role

Post-Unpause, Cool Bean has continued to build the V2 UI and onboard new contributors. Notable upcoming projects include:
* Embedding Snapshot governance into the UI;
* Preparing the site for open-sourcing;
* Building an improved Pod Marketplace;
* Integrating new liquidity pools into the site as they are added; and
* Generally building whatever needs to get built from a UI perspective.

## Payment

25,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

As BIPs continue to be audited, proposed and committed, Beanstalk Farms has a dire need for high quality frontend code to reach feature parity with the Beanstalk contract.

In order to match the high standard of the protocol, Beanstalk Farms is motivated to attract the best talent with industry premium wages. Beanstalk Farms is more inclined to hire a few key extremely proficient contributors at a premium price than 7 or 8 contributors at a standard price. Cool Bean has already proven this proficiency over the last few months.

Beanstalk Farms believes this hiring philosophy will lead to lean development teams that are highly efficient, fast-paced and much more productive than a standard larger team. This type of wage distribution should allow Beanstalk Farms to maintain a lean budget while properly compensating its premium contributors for their work.

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
