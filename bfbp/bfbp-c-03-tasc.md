## Summary

* Pay 34,752.50 Beans and 34,752.50 USDC to TASC Group for public relations and communications services during the period of September 1 to November 31, 2022.

## Incentive Alignment

TASC Group has agreed to be compensated partially in Beans and verbally expressed intent to retain long-term Bean exposure. This is a healthy setup that creates mutual interest in the success of Beanstalk.

## Rationale 

TASC Group has consistently been a great partner to Beanstalk Farms and has landed news about Beanstalk in various reputable publications like [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/technology/crypto-hacks-defi.html), [Blockworks](https://blockworks.co/playing-the-were-not-terra-stablecoin-game/), [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hacked-crypto-startups-get-capital-infusions-from-investors-11651053602), [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/beanstalk-stablecoin-protocol-barn-raise-aims-to-restore-77m-in-lost-funds/), [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/146068/hacked-stablecoin-beanstalk-seeks-to-borrow-77-million-to-revive-itself), etc.
