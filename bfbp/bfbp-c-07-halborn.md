## Summary

Hire [Halborn](https://www.halborn.com/) on a one-month retainer (thru end of June) to provide two smart contract audit workstreams. Use 15,000 USDC and the Bean equivalent of 15,000 USDC from the Audit Fund to pay for the retainer, based on the Bean price at the time of payment.

These audit streams are intended to be used for the Silo V3 and Basin Integration BIPs.

## Auditor

Beanstalk Farms and Halborn have a longstanding partnership and Halborn has [audited significant amounts of code in the Beanstalk ecosystem](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Audits). Having an auditor with domain knowledge and context on Beanstalk is ideal.

Halborn, founded in 2019, is a cybersecurity firm with over 100 security engineers who provide security advisory services, penetration testing, smart contract audits, and DevOps and automation consulting.

## Incentive Alignment

Halborn has agreed to accept half of their payment in Beans and expressed intent to retain long-term Bean exposure. This is a healthy setup that creates mutual interest in the success of Beanstalk.

## Payment

15,000 USDC and the Bean equivalent of 15,000 USDC from the Audit Fund, based on the Bean price at the time of payment (paid upfront).
