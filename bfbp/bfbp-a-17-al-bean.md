## Summary

Increase Al Bean's pay as full-time Senior Full-Stack Engineer from 18,750 to 25,000 Beans/mo.

## Role

As Senior Full-Stack Engineer for Beanstalk Farms, Al Bean has led technical development of the [Beanstalk SDK](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-SDK) from inception to beta release. In addition to pure development, this required significant cross functional work in order for the SDK to faciliate the launch of the Root UI.

Over the coming months, the expectation is that Al Bean continue development on the Beanstalk SDK in order to support the full suite of functionality supported in the protocol (first by migrating all existing Beanstalk UI functionality into the SDK, and then extending the SDK's capabilities related to composing transactions).

This is high leverage work that is critical to improving the developer experience of building on top of Beanstalk.

## Payment

25,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from December 16th, 2022 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs). This agreement is in place of the payment terms outlined in [BFBP-A-10](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarmsbudget.eth/proposal/0x2ed70de75a9192324a9f28abf7d0202fe670162d9c302f8aae039c57fa733c8f).

In order to match the high standard of the Beanstalk protocol itself, Beanstalk Farms is motivated to attract and retain the best talent with industry premium wages. Beanstalk Farms is more inclined to hire a few key extremely proficient contributors at a premium price than several contributors at a standard price. Al Bean has already proven this proficiency over the last few months.

Beanstalk Farms believes this hiring philosophy will lead to lean development teams that are highly efficient, fast-paced and much more productive than a standard larger team. This type of wage distribution should allow Beanstalk Farms to maintain a lean budget while properly compensating its premium contributors for their work.

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
