## Summary

Hire Brean full-time as a Solidity Engineer.

## Role

As a part-time Solidity Engineer for Beanstalk Farms, Brean has:
* Led technical development of the Barn Raise BeaNFTs; and
* [Shipped code to introduce a Dutch auction in the Field](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/133) (dubbed Morning Auction) and documented the proposed changes via [RFCs](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/86). This code is now being audited by Halborn. 

Brean is expected to work on Silo V3 next. This will include development work such as:
* Bringing the Withdrawal timer down to 0;
* Distributing Bean seigniorage to Stalkholders over the course of a Season, rather than once per Season at `sunrise()`;
* Implementing liquid Stalk and Seeds; and
* Implementing a Stalk Gauge System, among other work.

This is high leverage work that is critical to improving the efficiency and composability of Beanstalk.

## Payment

15,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from November 1st, 2022 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs). This agreement is in place of the payment terms outlined in [BFBP-A-9](https://arweave.net/V0q_L2pbozWShnlq73Boajm14k9rrdu2cglCAF0RC3Y).

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
