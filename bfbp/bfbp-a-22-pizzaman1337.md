## Proposer

Silo Chad

## Summary

Hire pizzaman1337 part-time as a Solidity Engineer.

## Background

pizzaman1337 is a mobile software and security engineer with 14 years of development and reverse engineering experience. They were previously at a small startup where they led the company's architectural and technical decisions. They have prior experience in crypto security through reporting bugs through bounty programs.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

As the recipient of multiple development grants from Beanstalk Farms, pizzaman1337 has primarily led technical development of the Silo upgrade that adds support for dynamic Seeds per BDV, which includes:
* Indexing Deposits based on cumulative Stalk per BDV instead of Season (which lays the foundation for a Gauge System and gives the DAO the ability to change the Seeds per BDV for a whitelisted asset);
* Migrating Silo Members from Silo V2 to Silo V3; and
* Significant code review of all upcoming changes in Silo V3.

See [RFC: Dynamic Seeds per BDV](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/411).

## Role

pizzaman1337's role will vary depending on needs, but generally revolve around contract development. Expected work includes:
* Facilitating conversions between Wells and Curve pools as part of the Basin Integration BIP (Generalized Convert);
* Unripe λ to λ conversions;
* Adding a StableSwap Well pricing function to Basin; and
* Generally building whatever needs to get built from a Solidity perspective.

This is high leverage work that is critical to improving the efficiency and composability of Beanstalk and Basin.

## Payment

8,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from April 17th, 2023 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs). 

## Commitment

Part-time (~20 hr/wk).
