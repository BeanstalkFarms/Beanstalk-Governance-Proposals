## Summary

Fund a [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) audit of Basin. Use 26,000 USDC and ~28,600 Beans from the Audit Fund to pay for the audit.

## Auditor

Code4rena facilitates community driven contests for smart contract audits. Code4rena has a high quality reputation and no Code4rena audited code has lost any user funds in 2 years of audit contests.

Decentralized security programs with aligned incentives for auditors have proven to have high efficacy in protecting code in the Beanstalk ecosystem (see [Immunefi](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkbugbounty.eth)). Although Basin has already been audited by Halborn and Cyfrin, the protocol will be non-upgradable, therefore it is prudent to frontload security work before deployment.

## Payment

The audit contest is planned to start at the end of June / beginning of July 2023 and last 5 days. The award pool for the audit will be 40,000 USDC. 

Payment from Beanstalk Farms will be as follows:
* 26,000 USDC (which contributes to the award pool);
* $28,600 worth of Beans based on the Bean price at the time of payment (which contributes to the award pool and covers the Code4rena operating fee); and
* 10,000 USDC (which is a refundable deposit).
