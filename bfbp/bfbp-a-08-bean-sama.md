## Summary

Hire Bean-Sama full-time as a Frontend Engineer.

## Background

Bean-Sama is a software engineer who has experience working for various startups and tech companies.

Past experience in crypto includes:
* Building core internal and external SDKs to support a network of frontends built on top of various smart contracts; and
* Architecting and building a production frontend from scratch to facilitate on-chain activity like lending, options trading, staking, etc.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

Bean-Sama allocated some time to contributing to Beanstalk after the exploit, but their time has been historically constrained due to other obligations. Fortunately, they are now able to join Beanstalk Farms in a full-time capacity.

Contributions since the exploit include:
* Building significant portions of the first couple of iterations of the Barn Raise UI prior to Beanstalk UI V2; and
* Assisted in building small portions of the current Beanstalk UI V2, e.g. Sunrise table on the top of the site.

## Role

Bean-Sama will focus on the various engineering work to be done across the frontend and SDKs. Expected work includes:
* Contributing to the Beanstalk UI V2 and Beanstalk SDKs;
* Preparing the SDKs and UI V2 for open-sourcing;
* Building various frontend functionality to reach feature parity with Beanstalk as new BIPs go live; and
* Generally building whatever needs to get built from a UI perspective.

## Payment

16,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from Monday September 5, 2022 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Full-time (40+ hr/wk).
