guy, Silo Chad, sweetredbeans, mod323

## Summary

Hire [SCRIB3](https://www.scrib3.co/) to initiate a multi-faceted marketing engagement for Beanstalk and its broader ecosystem. Use 30,000 Beans per month from the Beanstalk Farms budget to fund the engagement from March 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023.

## SCRIB3

Beanstalk Farms has connected with SCRIB3, a content studio and marketing agency focused on Web3.

SCRIB3's co-founder, [Ishan](https://twitter.com/Ishanb22), is familiar with Beanstalk as a long-standing community member.

SCRIB3 understands the barriers to adoption for complex DeFi concepts and systems. By leveraging SCRIB3's expertise and resources, Beanstalk can effectively expand its reach and boost understanding of the protocol, accelerating growth and adoption. SCRIB3 has successfully built marketing relationships with established DeFi projects such as [Gains Network](https://gainsnetwork.io/). Since starting their engagement in August 2022, SCRIB3 has significantly increased Gains Network's [social media engagement](https://twitter.com/therossbooth/status/1615747000087240704) and [protocol activity](https://dune.com/unionepro/Everthing-Gains-Network).

SCRIB3 will:

* Create long-form educational content to increase understanding of Beanstalk and its mechanisms. The content will aim to reduce friction and complexity for readers interested in Beanstalk.
* Help establish a strong and consistent social media presence for Beanstalk, especially on Twitter to reach new potential Farmers and convert website visitors to community members.
* Leverage media outlets to share the Beanstalk story, introducing Beanstalk to new audiences and attracting more community members. SCRIB3 will highlight Beanstalk's narrative around community resilience.

## Incentive Alignment

SCRIB3 has agreed to be compensated in Beans and verbally expressed intent to retain long-term Bean exposure and actively participate in Beanstalk governance. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement that fosters long-term interest in Beanstalk's success.

## Payment

30,000 Beans per month from the H1 2023 Beanstalk Farms budget. The engagement with SCRIB3 began on March 1st, 2023. This Snapshot approves at most 4 months before a second proposal should be submitted.
