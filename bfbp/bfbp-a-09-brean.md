## Proposer

Silo Chad

## Summary

Hire Brean part-time as a Solidity Engineer.

## Background

Brean is an electrical and software engineer, and has contributed to other protocol DAOs in the past. Prior experience was in the areospace and robotics industry focusing on control systems and low level embedded system development.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

Brean began contributing to Beanstalk after the exploit and has been working part-time on various engineering projects since then. Contributions to Beanstalk include:
* Developing [Curve simulation software for Beanstalk](https://github.com/BrianOlympus/Curveswap-Stuff) to determine how the A factor impacts price volatility;
* Contributed to smart contract testing and UI verification leading up to Replant; and
* Leading technical development of the [Barn Raise BeaNFTs](https://bean.money/blog/beanft-barn-raise-collection).

## Role

Post-Unpause, Brean has continued to work on the BeaNFT contracts and various engineering efforts. Expected work includes:
* Continuous development and maintenance of data analysis software for Beanstalk Farms; 
* Contributing to a BIP to introduce a Dutch auction in the Field;
* Adding a StableSwap variant to the Beanstalk AMM; and
* Polishing the [WIP technical documentation](https://beanstalk.gitbook.io/beanstalk-protocol/overview/beanstalk) to make it easier for developers to work on Beanstalk.

## Payment

10,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Part-time (~30 hr/wk).
