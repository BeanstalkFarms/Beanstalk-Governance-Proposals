## Summary

* Increase CanadianBennett’s hours to 20 hours per week.

## Role

As Operations Associate, CanadianBennett’s primary responsibility has been the end-to-end management of Discord meeting operations (recording, uploading, creating timestamps, maintaining the Beanstalk Learning Center, etc.)

Over the last couple weeks, this scope has increased to taking notes for each meeting, creating video clips from meetings to post on YouTube/Twitter (coming soon), among other miscellaneous operations tasks that come up on an ad hoc basis. CanadianBennett has been consistently spending ~20 hours per week on all of these various tasks, although his original hiring proposal was for 10 hours per week. 

This work is critical for improving and maintaining a high level of information dissemination within (and outside of) the community.

## Payment

4,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from October 15th, 2022 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs). This agreement is in place of the payment terms outlined in [BFBP-A-2](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarmsbudget.eth/proposal/0x5873dc652ee9e8d45e91f2c4cd37e2d35b3993190e1a61c5d9f24099a6acf1ee).

## Commitment

Part-time (average of 20 hr/wk).
