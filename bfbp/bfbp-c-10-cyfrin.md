## Summary

Hire [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io/) to perform security audits of the next two BIPs from Beanstalk Farms. Use up to 90,000 Beans in total from the Audit Fund to pay for the two audits.

## Auditor

Cyfrin is an audit firm started by [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC), a smart contract engineer and educator.

Members of the Cyfrin team are responsible for creating [two of the most watched Solidity YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) of all time, [billion dollar DeFi integrations](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/119), [security content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZ8gH-toX0), and have often topped the [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard).

Cyfrin has already [audited Basin](https://arweave.net/usT3ClfjHwpX32OXnh5De1aH79csX1PMoXJCghXBaps) and now that Cyfrin has completed their audit of [Beanstalk up to BIP-37](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarmsbudget.eth/proposal/0xba995682016736af8bfb8cc4a25adec8a46fdc1c09374e0d02af84483954f44a) (final report forthcoming), they can audit new BIPs.

The next two BIPs from Beanstalk Farms are expected to be:
* Migrate urBEAN3CRV to urBEANETH
* Seed Gauge System

## Payment

Upon the passage of this proposal, Beanstalk Farms will send the payment for the first BIP audit. Upon the preparation of a final commit hash for the second BIP audit, Beanstalk Farms will send the payment for the second BIP audit. The total cost of the two audits shall not exceed 90,000 Beans without an additional BFBP.
