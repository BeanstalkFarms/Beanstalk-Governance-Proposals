## Summary

Fund [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) competitive audits for implementations of the following RFCs:
* [RFC: Whitelist BEANwstETH and Migrate to urBEANwstETH](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/731) for 38,500 Beans; and
* [RFC: Multi Flow v1.1.0](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Basin/issues/126) for (up to) 20,000 Beans; and
* [RFC: Misc. Improvements]() for (up to) 30,000 Beans, which includes:
    * [RFC: On-Chain Fert Metadata](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/741); 
    * [RFC: Soil Issuance Update](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/739); and
    * [RFC: BDV Decrease](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/728).

## Proposal

[Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) is a competitive audit platform facilitated by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io/). The [Codehawks Seed Gauge audit](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clsxlpte900074r5et7x6kh96) has shown that having judges with context on the protocol (as Cyfrin does) is a significant value add for determining the validity and severity of the reports. As discussed in past DAO meetings, the implementations for the BEANwstETH upgrade and Multi Flow v1.1.0 are ready for audit.

The [BEANwstETH audit competition](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clu7665bs0001fmt5yahc8tyh) started on Monday, April 1, 2024 and is expected to last 2 weeks, followed by the Multi Flow v1.1.0 audit for ~1 week and the Misc. Improvements audit for ~2 weeks.

The prize pool for the BEANwstETH audit is $35,000, with a 10% platform fee of $3,500 for a total cost of $38,500. The prize pools for the Multi Flow and Misc. Improvements audits have not been finalized but are expected to be around $15,000 and $20,000, respectively. Thus, this proposal conservatively approves spending for each audit up to 20,000 Beans and 30,000 Beans, respectively.
