## Proposer

Silo Chad

## Summary

Hire k-xo full-time as a Full-Stack Engineer.

## Background

k-xo previously worked as a full-stack developer at Volt Protocol creating a variety of smart contracts that were rigorously tested (unit, integration, fuzz and invariant) with Foundry and deployed to mainnet and Arbitrum, as well as working on front-end development. 

Prior to Volt Protocol, k-xo worked at Nethermind, contributing to the development of an options DeFi protocol. Before that, k-xo spent a year working at a web2 fintech startup.

## Role

k-xo's Beanstalk contributions over the past month have focused on Wells, including:

* Gas comparison testing between Wells and Uniswap;
* Gas cost estimations of Wells in Pipeline;
* Test suite improvements;
* Implementation of the gas-efficient `shift` function for multi-Well swaps; and
* Solidity code review.

They also contributed several improvements to the Beanstalk UI.

k-xo's role will vary depending on needs, but generally revolve around the UI, contracts and other supporting projects. Expected work in the near term includes:

- Solidity contributions and code reviews for various Beanstalk upgrades and ecosystem contracts (i.e., new Well functions, Silo V3.1, etc.);
- Wells BeaNFT contracts; and
- Integration of new protocol upgrades into the Beanstalk UI.

## Payment

12,500 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from Wednesday, March 1st, 2023 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Full-time (~40 hr/wk).
