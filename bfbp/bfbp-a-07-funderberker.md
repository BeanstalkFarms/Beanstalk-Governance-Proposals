## Summary

Hire funderberker part-time as Middleware Engineer.

## Background

funderberker is a software engineer who has worked at various companies in the past and has been making technical contributions to Beanstalk since November 2021.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

funderberker was originally hired as Middleware Engineer in the fall of 2021. Contributions since then include:
* Discord channel bots
    * Developed all of the bots that send messages in Discord and Telegram—the Seasons, Exchange, Peg Crosses, Contract Events, Pod Market and Fertilizer bots
* Barn Raise bots
    * Developed multiple sidebar bots to convey the progress and activity during the Barn Raise and post-Replant
* Bean Price and BeaNFT bots
    * Developed sidebar bots to show pertinent live status information
* [Twitter bots](https://twitter.com/BeanstalkBot)
    * Set up various bots to broadcast information through Twitter
* [Supporting Python tooling](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/beanstalk-py)
    * Implemented on top of an extensive set of Python tooling that is generalized and extensible—the code is public and is designed such that it will be available for future Beanstalk project implementations
* Bot hosting
    * Configured the cloud-hosted server that all in-house bots run on, which has historically had high uptime
* Bot maintenance
    * Updated bot code and Python tooling logic to account for various protocol changes and the Replant

## Role

As Middleware Engineer, funderberker’s primary responsibility will be the continued development and maintenance of the Discord, Telegram, and Twitter bots, along with the underlying tooling. Most new features of Beanstalk that are released will require new bots or updates to existing systems, which will be funderberker’s responsibility to implement in a timely fashion. 

Most of the bots requested by Beanstalk Farms and the community have been implemented in some capacity, so it is very likely that this role expands beyond the current scope of the Python tooling to include additional projects like subgraph or Typescript development.

## Payment

4,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Part-time (average of 10 hr/wk).
