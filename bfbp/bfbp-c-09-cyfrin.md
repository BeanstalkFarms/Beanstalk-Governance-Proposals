## Summary

Hire [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io/) to perform an end-to-end code audit on Beanstalk. Use ~120,000 Beans from the Audit Fund to pay for the audit.

## Auditor

Cyfrin is an audit firm started by [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC), a smart contract engineer and educator.

Members of the Cyfrin team are responsible for creating [two of the most watched Solidity YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) of all time, [billion dollar DeFi integrations](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/119), [security content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZ8gH-toX0), and have often topped the [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard).

Cyfrin has already [audited Basin](https://arweave.net/usT3ClfjHwpX32OXnh5De1aH79csX1PMoXJCghXBaps). In order to audit new BIPs, Cyfrin must first audit Beanstalk core.

## Incentive Alignment

Cyfrin has agreed to be compensated in Beans and verbally expressed intent to retain long-term Bean exposure with their payment for the Beanstalk core audit. This is a healthy setup that creates mutual interest in the success of Beanstalk.

## Payment

Cyfrin begins their audit of the core Beanstalk code on July 18, 2023. Beanstalk Farms has already sent Cyfrin [a deposit of 22,198 Beans](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x511081a8b920466f74741e3270ac9f02d8addf696fb09566ef092a851cbe67ce). Upon the passage of this proposal and preparation of a final commit hash, Beanstalk Farms will send the remainder of the $120,000 quote for the audit, based on the Bean price at the time of payment.
