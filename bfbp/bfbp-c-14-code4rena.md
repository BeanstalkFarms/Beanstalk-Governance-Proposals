## Proposer

Guy

## Summary

Fund a [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) audit and mitigation review of a Stable 2 Well Function and an Upgradable Well Implementation. Use 49,500 Beans from the Security Fund to pay for the audit.

## Auditor

Code4rena facilitates community driven contests for smart contract audits. Code4rena has a high quality reputation and no Code4rena audited code has lost any user funds in 3 years of audit contests.

Decentralized security programs with aligned incentives for auditors have proven to have high efficacy in protecting code in the Beanstalk ecosystem (see [Immunefi](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkbugbounty.eth)). The Stable 2 Well Function and Upgradable Well Implementation are yet to be unaudited.

## Payment

The audit contest is planned to start on Monday, July 29th. The award pool for the audit will be $37,500, with a total payment of 49,500 Beans to cover the award pool, the Code4rena fee and mitigation review.
