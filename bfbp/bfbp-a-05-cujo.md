## Proposer

Silo Chad

## Summary

Hire Cujo part-time as a Middleware Engineer.

## Background

Cujo is a data analyst and software engineer, and has contributed to other protocol DAOs in the past.

## Past Contributions to Beanstalk

Cujo began contributing to Beanstalk after the exploit and has been working part-time on various engineering projects since then. Contributions to Beanstalk include:
* Creating and testing the Fertilizer bid processing subgraph for a version of the Barn Raise that did not ultimately come to fruition.
* Worked with the engineering team to update the main Beanstalk subgraph and incorporate changes post-Replant.
    * Set up a new schema definition with time series snapshots available for both the Field and Silo; and
    * Incorporated UI needs for analytics and overall RPC use reduction by enabling the subgraph to be the primary data source for the Pod Market.
* Set up private testnet infrastructure for testing and subgraph development.
* Contributed to smart contract testing and UI verification leading up to Replant.

## Role

Post-Unpause, Cujo has continued to work on the Beanstalk subgraph. Expected work includes:
* Continuing to develop and maintain the subgraph for new BIPs as they are proposed.
* Supporting the frontend team with subgraph work around for analytics and other frontend functionality.
* Contributing to code review for subgraph PRs and BIPs as needed.

## Payment

9,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).

## Commitment

Part-time (~20 hr/wk).
