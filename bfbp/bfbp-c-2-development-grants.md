## Proposer

Silo Chad

## Proposal

* Pay grants to malteasy and m00n for their work on Pod Market V2 and Function Approvals + Permits, respectively.

## Rationale

### Pod Market V2

malteasy's work on dynamically priced Pod Orders and Listings is slated to be proposed as part of BIP-28. This is a significant upgrade to Beanstalk that required a number of novel decisions (including the introduction of a new library, see the RFC) and will improve the efficiency of the Pod Market.

Pull request: 
* [BIP-28](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/87)

RFC: 
* [Pod Market V2 (Price Functions)](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/88)

### Function Approvals + Permits

m00n's work on Function Approvals and ERC-20 token permits is finalized and expected to be proposed in an upcoming BIP. The ability for Farmers to delegate calls of various Beanstalk functions is a significant improvement in composability and will allow other protocols to provide automation functionality to Farmers.

Pull requests:
* [Function Approvals](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/95)
* [ERC-20 Token Permits](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/107)

RFCs: 
* [Function Approvals](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/84)
* [ERC-20 Token Permits](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/115)

## Payment

* 40,000 Beans to malteasy; and
* 14,000 Beans to m00n.
