## Proposer

sweetredbeans

## Summary

Hire fullofbeans part-time as a Visual Designer.

## Background

fullofbeans is a Visual Designer with several years of experience at well-known tech companies and a crypto exchange. They also have an extensive freelance portfolio.

## Role

In order to create a world-class user experience for other protocols and users who are considering utilizing the Wells architecture for its manipulation-resistant Oracle framework, it is important that Beanstalk Farms is capable of properly representing the value proposition to users who interact with the newly developed DEX via strong visuals. 

Given that we expect further development in the DEX architecture (supporting more asset types, greater customization for LP providers, etc.),  new users should not perceive the new DEX as the "Beanstalk DEX", but as a new DeFi primitive.

fullofbeans will work with sweetredbeans to define the visual identity of the new DEX. Expected work includes:
* Illustrative work for the homepage which clearly represents the Wells / Pumps architecture;
* Visual design system for each page in the application, including colors, layout, component styling, and typography decisions; and
* Logo design for the new DEX.

## Payment

6,300 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from March 17th, 2023 through May 11th, 2023. To be extended past May 11th, 2023 upon mutual agreement of both Beanstalk Farms and the Visual Designer.

## Commitment

Part-time (15 hr/wk).
