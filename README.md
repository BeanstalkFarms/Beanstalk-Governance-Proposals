# Beanstalk Governance Proposals

This is a repository of past Beanstalk governance proposals. You can read more about the active proposal types in the Farmers' Almanac: https://docs.bean.money/governance/proposals.

The Beanstalk DAO governs the [Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC)](https://docs.bean.money/governance/beanstalk-farms#beanstalk-farms-committee) and [Bean Sprout](https://docs.bean.money/governance/bean-sprout). The BFC has discretion over the [Beanstalk Farms](https://docs.bean.money/governance/beanstalk-farms) budget.
